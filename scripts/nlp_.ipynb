He cited this definition by erriamWebster existing in nature and not made or caused by people coming from nature  as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural. However I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankinds capacity to create problemsolve analyze rationalize and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature thus how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature I would understand the distinction between natural and manmade. However I think unnatural and manmade are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that manmade things UST be natural due to our being part of nature. I would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line. ',\n 'y wife has recently gotten deeply involvedobsessed with the healing properties of essential oils. I am cursed with a common problem in that I am an extremely skeptical person. I cant help but look at this product and see a pyramid scheme that takes advantage of the gullible. All the shit my wife watches on these oils is carefully worded to make sure they dont make actual healing claims Im told this is because they arent FDA approved and could get in trouble. Ive looked a little and havent found anything debunking these oils but i still cannot help but feel they are total BS. I would love to get more information from unbiased sources on this. Please change my view without just anecdotal testimonies. ',\n 'Thinking about todays news BB Wikipedia I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this. There would be even stronger calls for an antiislam and antiimmigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many who are afraid more then anything to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists which might have been the goal of the attack anyway. I think this regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if out of people carried a gun with them was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse and society upheld the value of these people as protectors it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the not one of us pack mentality and escalation of police state. hange my view. PS I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems. ',\n 'Ive been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an oversimplification of the view but Ill elaborate more here. Technically its a twopart view Explaining causation is not blaming the victim. Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor. Id be happy to have either view changed though if view is changed Id probably change my mind on view . Itll be easier to change my mind in other words about view than view Im not certain that its a worthwhile endeavor. Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. Theres an unfortunate tendency that Ive noticed particularly on the Internet but occasionally in person as well to blame the victims of terrible situations. Were seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens people trying to find a reason why the person was shot and we see it with victims of rape people say you shouldnt have been so drunk or you shouldnt have been in that area of town. There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who dont deserve it. We like to think of our world as just in some way so we come up with reasons why these people Deserved what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman deserved to be raped but theres a certain amount of otherization and lack of empathy that goes on a sense that well that wouldnt have happened to me because I wouldve been more careful. Additionally it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And thats all bad. On the other hand it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes we can work towards justice we can work towards eliminating racism overt or structural and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime however it is important to understand lines of causation. Im not going with a very complicated definition of causation here basically a model in which two events or situations occur A and B and one event B would not have occurred the other A had not occurred. A caused B. Im aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model but thats not the view Im trying to have changed if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points go ahead. The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe for the most part but there are certain areas that you shouldnt walk in at night because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is if we hadnt been walking through those areas we wouldnt have gotten mugged. So we dont walk through those areas at night anymore. Its still possible that well get mugged elsewhere but in my mind weve decreased our chances which is a good thing. We didnt deserve to get mugged before but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again. Thus explaining causation is not justification. Its simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event. Finally my second view is that its a worthwhile endeavor. As I said we avoid those dangerous areas at night now and I feel weve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally all areas would be safe to walk in but theyre not so we dont walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes this has mildly restricted our behavior but its worth it to us so that we dont get mugged. I understood these are hairy issues and maybe theres a fine line between causation and justification. . As far as part of my view goes I still stand by my original statement. Granted people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term causation but as I said Im not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that its very complex and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of eventsoutcomes my point was never to say that avoid certain areas means you wont get mugged or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk a change in probability. Furthermore the point itself was actually that explaining causation is not victim blaming and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. Ive changed my view to the point that I dont think explaining causation is always the appropriate response particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault. I do still think its often important to explain causation before the fact as some users have suggested as an alternative simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. ost specifically no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said theyre the same thing but not really offered an explanation for that. At any rate Ive enjoyed reading the responses so far Im aware this is a sensitive issue and Im glad discussions have remained pretty civil. ',\n 'Ive been thinking about this issue for a while.

I consider myself one of those people and was initially driven to this subreddit in the hope that I would meet other people like myself that were posting here to educate themselves. The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light. But far and away this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles yesterdays atheism post used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP if you read that post was by and large not interested in changing his opinion and this is true of the vast majority of posts that come through here. And the problem is this it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times the posts are not controversial they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places a million internet hits which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesmreligion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person or rather a person seeking to educate himself would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource. Additionally the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already even before submitting. Go ahead think of something you believe that is controversial and click Submit . Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this it takes considerable effort to open ones mind even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this. Thanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post albeit maybe not today and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.

I am almost continually tense while on the road thinking about whats at stake and Ive been driving for almost years. While I have never been in an accident I often find myself thinking how dangerous even small motions of a driver can be. For example a sudden small jerking movement of an arm on the steering wheel leading the car into oncoming traffic can lead to almost certain instant death. I cannot think of any other action in my daily life where so many small actions of me or other people can be lethal. Even leaving accidents and catastrophic scenarios out of consideration driving a car seems extremely risky to me For many maybe most people their car is the most expensive single item that they own. Even small mistakes like a lack of concentration or a tiny miscalculation while parking into a small space can lead to high damage and expensive repairs.

For example a sudden small jerking movement of an arm on the steering wheel leading the car into oncoming traffic can lead to almost certain instant death. I cannot think of any other action in my daily life where so many small actions of me or other people can be lethal. Even leaving accidents and catastrophic scenarios out of consideration driving a car seems extremely risky to me For many maybe most people their car is the most expensive single item that they own. Even small mistakes like a lack of concentration or a tiny miscalculation while parking into a small space can lead to high damage and expensive repairs. ',\n 'Note Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post. I am not religious. Thank you. ALSO By meaningless I mean meaningless to the person who is doing the dying. To the person who is alive and who will then die life is meaningless. . Assuming there is no afterlife life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die. Death is the great eraser. Living life is as irrational as reading a book that after finished is immediately erased from your memory. It is comparable to that too. It makes no difference if I a year old die now or live until I am and die. Either way after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness. Not only do I remember nothing I A nothing. To me it is as if my life had never happened. Ill put it another way. Imagine the time before you were born. Have you remembered it yet? Of course not. You didnt exist. This is the state that we return to after deatha state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth. When I die I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness and I return to it permanently. I might as well have never lived. To anticipate a few responses Helping others doesnt matter. They will die too. And then their descendants will die on and on and on until eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heatdeath. Even if people were helped by me assuming they all die then my life is still pointless and meaningless. For I will be dead and wont know what I did and once they die they wont know either. Attaining fame doesnt matter and doesnt truly make me immortal. Ill be dead and again death is nothingness. Thus I wont be around to enjoy my fame. Enjoying the moment is possible but doesnt make life have a point. For once I die all memories and all point is gone. Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.

It seems that medical responders even hospital staff actually and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers and that such discounts should be given to them. As for the Theyre not risking their lives for our country. argument police officers do that too and for citizens rather than the country and its interests. Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help but thats usually the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate. Im really hoping theres a good reason behind the status quo but well see. It looks like theres even less reason behind it than I initially thought actually. y views been changed. In summary I think that ES people are just as deserving of these discounts and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category but I now believe for the same reason that these discounts shouldnt be offered at all.

Something in the ballpark of of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society increase crime rates suck up resources and generally screw things up. arious ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored if not because of this million then because of the next million. One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population even with a country facing similar issues would cost not only resources but it would also cause political cultural and global issues. Americas innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middleclass child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were million more around. NoteIm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them? Was view changed? Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs or are the millions of illegals from exico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher noneabortion population? Doesnt immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics? choppy writing but im on hours of sleep and stretched for time give me a break Side thought Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons but surely its a significant number so how many of these women wouldnt be having financial troubles if there wasnt competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. onclusion exicans are the supreme race native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then outbreeding. no that isnt a serious sentiment im just saying this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems or would having a higher population from noneabortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a neverconsideredforabortion fetus but in an industrial society its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not. Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from noneabortions results in a strain for resources in the country. odern technology like the internet must be considered.

A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand and thus potential revenue to all meatproducing farms regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are. a Since the majority of farms are large factory farms I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. However Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meatgrowing which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare. y general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. oreover this practice would be much easier to evangelize than a vegetarian or vegan diet. Face it meat is tasty and nonfactory meat is often tastier than factoryfarmed meat at least in my own anecdotal experience ',\n 'According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken. Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature. Lets call it X. Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken but at some point it does. An X not a chicken lays the first chicken egg. The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist. Am I wrong? PS Im playing laser tag soon so I will respond in ish minutes.',\n 'American patriots have a general mentality against immigration. Saying these people shouldnt be allowed to become part of the country is the same as saying they are worse because they were born on a different side of a line and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes namely the slogan reating jobs for americans. I understand why politics use this slogan because they are trying to get americans to vote for them but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries. The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market so they can sell more of their product but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief. I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better because of the side of a line they are born on that are at fault. Patriotism is really just this belief. ',\n 'Because of the anonymity on chan people are more prone to not think through care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults. They will care about how people respond to them but since its largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity. Surrounding the entire site theres a general pessimistic group mentality and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group. Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate women SJWs casual gamers Jews and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups. On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof. Things about ecelebrities will start as rumors ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until its taken as fact. It will reach conspiracy theory levels of proof where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a groupeffort thats uncovering something. Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic negative and possibly depressive person.

Not from the movie but from here  It summed up my feelings about the movie quite well. Throughout human history conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. Its ruthless yes but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation invention progress technology and science. Not only does this secure survivability but also increases standard of living. olonel Quaritch as well as the other miners were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Navi inhabited. Arguably olonel Quaritch OULD have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead a chance to evacuate is given and Quaritches forces target Hometree itself not the Navi The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree and not the extermination of the people. Next Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Navi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch OULD have met them in battle but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Navi and Human. The culture of the Navi could have ended up like the Native Americans. onquered but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance and Im interested to see what the sequel holds for them. In the mean time I feel olonel Quaritchs actions were rational reasonable justifiable and the correct course of action. y friend disagreed and Im more than open for discussion to better understand the opposing view.

If the date today is I feel that given the date on the container that the egg nog within is near a point where you should no longer ingest it. It is my opinion that since the contents of the container are near expiration that the decomposition process has begun and should be thrown out. Sell by dates only offer me more uncertainty as to when I should stop ingesting the contents. TLDR Expiration dates are times when the contents of a container are spoiled. So I think you should throw them out prior to this date. Additionally sell by dates are worse because you have no idea when the contents will expire.

In common parlance theory means a guess whereas in science theory means a body of knowledge including all known facts hypotheses and natural laws relevant to a particular field of study or a proposed explanation of a set of related facts or a given phenomenon. In general when the term steep learning curve is used in common parlance it used to describe something difficult to learn. Eg The video game Dark Souls has a very steep learning curve. What this sentence is meant to convey is that the game is hard to learn and master which is clearly described by a shallow learning curve not a steep one. In conclusion saying This game is hard it has a steep learning curve is equivalent to saying I could care less when what one meant was I couldnt care less',\n 'To be clear Im talking about researchdesignprogrammingITcall center jobs where you arent in the public eye or arent representing the company with your physical body. If youre going and making house calls as an IT guy then this doesnt apply. Basically I think that its absurd to have a company tell you that only certain pieces of clothing are acceptable to wear to type on a keyboard or operate a phone. As long as the worker is getting their job done how they dress should be completely irrelevant so long as they arent distracting or offending other people at the office. To head off some arguments I dont believe that wearing a collared shirt and pants that arent jeans are representative that you respect the job any more than I believe that sweatpants and a tshirt are signs that you disrespect the job. What I think would change my view would be any sort of evidence that theres a benefit to having a workplace full of programmers or a call center always wearing slacks or skirts and nice tops. ',\n 'Okay so this is an argument I have all the time being a teenager myself . usually what happens is Ill be discussing a topic with an adult usually a family member or teacher then we disagree then they say something that infuriates me like oh I thought the same thing when I was your age or youll grow out of it. even online there is this annoying stigma that all teens are idiots but at the same time think they know everything. sometimes it makes sense. some subjects obviously require experience. Relationship advice for example. Ive never been in a relationship so if I were to try and give an adult or anyone for that matter relationship advice it would make sense to tell me youre too youngyour opinion will changeyoull grow out of it. but when arguing about politics religion or any subject that really doesnt require experience to understand it better saying something like youre just a teen or I used to think like that is an excuse and it usually means you have nothing more to say but arent willing to lose this discussion to a stupid teen. personally Im unsurprisingly an atheist. I come from a semireligious Jewish family. me and my dad have this argument ALL THE TIE. you know the one. and it almost always ends with me bringing up an extremely valid point and him laughing and saying oh its just a phase. youre just a teen. youre so young. you have no idea. it fucking pisses me off. A teenager can argue about politics or religion just as well as a year old can and just as well as a year old can. it only depends on the person and how much they are willing to put into learning about the subject. ',\n 'The reasons for this are different depending on whether you are religious or not. I am intentionally not stating my own beliefs as its not relevant EDIT actually its pretty obvious! If you are religious the chances are high that your religion only allows believers into heavenparadise after our earthly lives end. Some may go even further and state that if you dont believe not only will you not go to heaven you will end up in hell. People who follow these religions have a moral duty to do all they can to help people get into heavenavoid hell. If some otherwise decent guy is an atheist doesnt he deserve to be converted so he can get into heaven? And as for hell noone not even Hitler deserves an ETERNITY of torture. I admit that religious people who do not believe in hell or heaven have no moral obligation to try and convert people. Atheists generally believe that their worldview leads to greater human happiness. A rough spectrum of examples of religion decreasing human happiness from significantly decreasing to only a little ISIS Hamas v Isreal sick children being prevented treatment due to religious parents parents disowning a child for coming out as gay spending Sunday at church instead of doing something more fun. Atheists therefore have a moral obligation to spread their viewpoint in order to make the world a better place. Atheists who insist on never trying to convert a religious person are doing the world a disservice what if the person you didnt want to convert goes on to drive their own child to suicide because they said god doesnt make mistakes regarding their childs transexuality? Of course there are atheists who do NOT believe that atheism leads to greater human happiness. Again I admit that these people have no moral obligation to convert people from their point of view. ',\n 'Ive seen some discussion about this topic where many kids and adults may call people something they arent to try and insult them. For example Thats so gay and You throw like a girl type insults. any people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic but I dont believe thats necessarily the case at all. I think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesnt think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks theyre inferior but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away. Women in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because thats manly. But they probably dont hate men. Similarly being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic but because they are being called something they are not. I think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are misgendered Purposely. It is a deliberate refusal of their identity. No one says a trans woman is a misandrist if she hates being referred to as he. The people calling them he are also unlikely to hate men but say it to hurt the trans person. So insults such as those above arent necessarily homophobic or misogynist. They sting because they are an affront to identity more so than because being gay or a woman is a bad thing.

',\n 'First let me clarify that antifeminism isnt necessarily antiwomens rights but against the belief in the patriarchy and institutional misogyny. Feminists often try to silence womens criticisms of feminism by saying they have internalized misogyny. I dont believe this is the case. A lack of belief in the patriarchy can be caused by the lack of empirical evidence. Examples of misogyny and discrimination dont have to be ignored or excused as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy nor institutional misogyny. Saying a woman has internalized misogyny discredits her experience of what may be a lack of being victimized. Telling a woman shes a victim when shes not is belittling. This is what draws many women away from feminism.',\n 'y logic basically stems from the idea of If you cant afford to have child you cant have a child. Let me explain. In my opinion if one parent wants to keep the child and the other doesnt then unless they can be proven unfit for parenting this includes financial instability then good for them go for it. The only time I could see child support being necessary is if they parent needs the extra money to support their children. But Im sorry you cant have a child if you cant support it and you sure as hell cant take the money from someone else regardless of their involvement in the childs creation. Obviously its a different story if they are splitting custody then an arrangement should be made about how the money should be split. If only the mother wants the child then she can have it and raise it by herself or with whomever she wants. If only the father wants the child then its up to the mother if she wants to have it and the forfeit custody to him after birth. If she does then its the fathers responsibility alone. No strings attached. I realize that its to stop guys from knocking up women and then running off and leaving her to raise it but she can just get an abortion if she cant raise it. Or put it up for adoption find a willing guardian ex. friend parent etc. if she doesnt want to do that. Not to mention the fact that both of them should have taken precautions to avoid pregnancy beforehand though I admit nothings fool proof.

I am aware that this practice is somewhat controversial due to hacking risks but I have heard friends and neighbors say that if you arent paying by the byte there is no harm in allowing others to use your WiFi. Although there are horror stories about people being SWATted by those on their WiFi network I dont think the risks of that are statistically much higher than many other technology risks including using a guessable password like or browsing the Internet on library or Starbucks WiFi. Id prefer some statistics and would be more likely to award a delta for a statistically demonstrable argument.

We are capable of recognizing choices that is obvious but Im not convinced that the chemical pathways for neurons leaves any room for decisions to be made other than the ones that are made.There is no more room in the chemical pathways for us to choose to do anything any more than there is for bacteria or plants to do the same. hemistry behaves the way it does regardless of what we want it to do and our decisions are made by chemical controlled signaling between cells. Is there any room for our nerves to come to any other result than the one they do given that chemical pathways we have no control over are the primary factors in the decisions we make?

The second prong of attack is the rule against cross dressing. However if someone really is the opposite gender its not cross dressing. The third prong of attack is against physical mutilation of the body. I think there are other things wrong with this argument.

',\n 'Although there is something kind of special about owning a physical copy of a favorite movie or album I no longer see any reason to purchase a piece of physical media in todays world of technology that includes such a vast array of services. There are two main reasons Streaming and subscription services have exploded at a staggering rate. Look at Spotify and Netflix as the prime examples. For an incredibly cheap price or sometimes at no price at all you can listen to almost any song your heart desires or watch any movie that strikes your interest. Yes it is true that both of these services do not have literally everything but as the years go on these services will only get better to the point where it is virtually impossible to not have access to a movie or song. Storage devices will only continue to increase in storage capacity. Why own a disc that takes up physical space in your household when you can download all of your T shows movies and music onto your computer? any people today are creating their own home servers with tons of storage space to hold all their media. Granted this is a bit difficult for those who are not tech savvy but a few years from now Im positive that obtaining a server for your media and being able to place media on it will become an incredibly simple process. As one final less important point physical media is restricted in its quality. What you purchase is what you get. For example DDs are not capable of playing movies in full HD. In order to get the best quality you need to repurchase your DDs in bluray. But even now blurays are being outdone by k quality! How long will this continue for? Id love to hear your opinions because despite this I do have an irrational attraction to physical Ds.',\n 'First of all I understand the underlying arguments for women being the sole decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion. I also understand the underlying arguments for a man being on the hook for child support. However I believe that these arguments clash against each other and I feel that men should either be able to waive their financial obligations to their child or they should partake in the decision for the woman to get an abortion. Women should be the decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion because they should have control of their own bodies This is a perfectly valid point. In this argument the fetus is being treated as a part of the womans body and therefore the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the wellbeing of the fetus and its future. en should be on the hook for child support because we shouldnt be focused on the parents but rather the wellbeing of the child This also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing the needs of the parents shouldnt be placed before the needs of the child. However if we take the argument that women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus then it should also be right to say that men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus. If we take the argument that the wellbeing of the child should come before the wellbeing of the parents then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the wellbeing of the childs future. I find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body but when it comes to men their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man. Therefore I believe that men should either have abortion rights or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child while abortion is still an option. Note Im not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing. I actually agree with the views of many feminists on paternal rights such as the ones highlighted in this article y argument is against the current laws that exist I am absolutely not trying to antagonize women.',\n 'Think about it. If they have no means to pay the copyright holder either because they have the money but not the compatible payment media for example Sony doesnt accept debit cards at least from many countries or they have no money at all. All theyre doing is downloading something that is available on the internet. They would not have been able to pay the copyright holder even if they wanted to and thus they are causing no loss to the copyright holder. Whether it is moral to enjoy something without paying for it is questionable I would allege as much as overcharging for goods and services as is the practice. However that is not what I want a discussion on. I want only to discuss about whether and if yes then how loss is caused to the copyright holder by people who illegally download copyrighted content without paying as they have no means to make the payment.',\n 'Rather than having a fixed number of income tax bands there should be a continuous function relating your salary to the rate of tax that you pay. In the following example Im making up numbers to demonstrate a point so it wont be accurate I dont think it makes sense to tax someone on their first k and on their next k. It would be better to break it down further so that they are taxed on the first k on the next k and on the next k. Tax rate should be increased bit by bit as someones salary increases rather than having big jumps in tax rate. With a single formula there are no jumps and this leads to a fairer tax system. Heres a graph of a function which I came up with  the very rich pay tax on their salary and those earning pay tax. Of course no one earns but this could easily be adjusted so that minimum wage earners pay and those slightly above minimum pay very little. One of Adam Smiths canons of taxation is that the tax system should be simple or understandable by the public. This means that the bands system is more attractive because of its simplicity but I do not think that it is too complicated to be practical. The function would not require more than so a simple calculator could do the job. The example I gave a graph of is just cS where S is salary and c is a constant that determines how quickly the result reaches tax rate. The taxing function could be evaluated and the public could be supplied with other formulae for answers to questions like If I get a raise from k to k how much does my income go up by? so the taxing system remains simple to the public. ',\n 'aking something illegal doesnt make people want it any less there has only been a deterrent created. Stealing is illegal but that doesnt mean people dont want to steal that new thing that just hit the market or that thing they need but cant afford it just means that deterrent is more effective than their want of the thing. Likewise making a drug illegal does not magically make people not want to do that drug youve just made a deterrent. A deterrent isnt going to stop a heroin addict from getting his fix and overcoming withdrawal youve just changed where he gets it from and how much it costs and the risks associated with it. The user now has to go to a sketchy dealer the dealer has many tiers of other sketchy dealers all the way up to the cartel behind it all and that cartel is arguably more destructive than the drug itself and so is the war against the drug. aking abortion illegal isnt going to stop women from wanting an abortion youve just made it much less likely for them to get it done safely. If that woman was raped and she doesnt want to carry a reminder of her attacker she isnt going to care that some piece of paper says shes not allowed to do that shes going to find a some shady doctor with a revoked license to do it for her or shes going to take a coat hanger to herself. ',\n 'Well while I was discussing the effects of feminism on another post a reddit user made a very good point in saying that femaleonly gyms and shelters are discriminatory. That was something I never thought about! I could honestly see how it could be discriminatory men might like to have their own private workout areas too and they also can be victims of abuse. I cant refute that its discriminatory of course because it is or at least I think it is. But I also believe its important for women to be and feel safe. As I mentioned to this particular reddit user my sister was harassed by her gym so badly that she ended up having to quit so obviously Im conflicted in my opinions! Now while I consider myself a feminist I consider myself more so an egalitarian and I believe that all people should be treated equally. So I would like to to better my practice of that philosophy. As it stands I would say that I still do think that femaleonly gyms and shelters are good things but if someone can and help make the issue a little clearer I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!

Now that my bias is clear I want to say that the completely irrational anger that you may see in the post below IS the reason Id like my view changed. I apologize for offending anyone and for sounding like an ass. Needless to say this post is really only meant for those whove played the series but if youre not afraid of spoilers then feel free to chime in. So heres the brunt of my If you let any one of your squadmates die unless their deaths are unavoidable you are a. incompetent Talk to squadmates semiregularly do the loyalty missions buy the ship upgrades and for Gabens sake put some points into persuade you Neanderthal! and dont make stupid YES STUPID choices during the final E mission.

Its worth it dammit! b. rushingmissing the damn point of the game Dont give me that I dont have time crap you bought an RPG! Youre already taking a good bit time to play the game so why not take a little more and immerse yourself in the sexy scifi universe you paid good money for? You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore. c. unfit to fairly criticize the series Firstly I want to say that I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was see the original Kapysharn plot outline for details. However despite its shortcomings I believe that the real heart of the ass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative but with its characters. With only a couple exceptions the vast majority of Shepards crew are interesting fleshedout characters each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities. For example SPOILERS E seeing Wrex grow from a mere gunforhire in E to the responsible yet still badass leader of the Genophagefree Krogan in E was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for rfrission material. Without these experiences yeah ass Effect didnt live up to the hype. How could it? Its such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up or watching Tali commit suicide. In my opinion its a complete waste of the players time going about it that way. Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment I believe there is one right way to play ass Effect a completionist run where NO ONE dies. I need help guys. Its getting to the point where I cant even discuss ass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet. Hell Ive put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseatgaming during his playthrough. I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them but for whatever reason its different for me when it comes to ass Effect in particular. Please ! Bah apologies!

I like them both for different reasons but gun to my head I probably slightly prefer the films. The hobbit movies can S my D though. IO the extended cuts seriously throw off the pacing of the films. When watching the theatrical cuts I get swept into the story. When watching the extended cuts I get distracted and reminded that Im watching a movie. They break the fourth wall if you will. Peter Jackson agrees with me The main objection to this of course will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books and are therefore better. Personally I think its a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material rather than by the strength of its story telling. The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time precisely because they left a whole lot of the books unfilmed and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor. They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces Helmss Deep and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely Tom Bombadil. Basically Im glad Jackson opted to make excellent movies instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a book and I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard. Books and movies are not the same and in general the more an adaptation respects the inherent differences between the various media its adapting to and from the better the final product will be. This is much more important than its faithfulness to the source material. I believe this is true for all adaptations not just LOTR. Feel free to my on this larger point as well.

Sex is the most important part of a relationship and therefore betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. y belief sex is a very important part of a relationship but not the most important part.

One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors. There are few if any changes in gameplay and the basic level design for the most part remains the same. Even Advanced Warfare which seemed to promise the most novel changes was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games. Another reason for my opinion is that oD doesnt really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre. There are a few unique features here and there but overall its just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.

From what I can tell there is very little skill involved in playing the game it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through. onopoly was made with the intent to explain why localised monopolies are bad for the economy and to explain the Single Tax theory of Henry George. Though it does this job well I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once of the board has been claimed even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in anothers territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them. While this system would work in a quick game between to people monopoly is usually drawn out and played with players. One after another a player pays out the networth to the other players until there is a long long drawnout standoff between the remaining few. At this point it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going because it would be unfair to keep going despite the likely outcome. If onopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance perhaps a redesign of the board more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better hance cards or even removal of the pieces entirely and to be quicker Add penalties for each additional player over so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily for example then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone. As of right now after the first few passes around the board it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.

In particular The months are uneven. Its confusing to have irregular fluctuations in the length of months. Only one month having or days? Alternating between and lt days only to reverse at August? Theres no reason to have a complicated calendar just because some ancient emperors had oversized egos. has few factors so a perfect division is not practical but we can at least do better than what we have months have days and months have for example month would get Leap Day. onths do not line up with seasons. The equinoxes and solstices that define the seasons. Why have the season start of the way through the month when they could just happen on the first or second making that entire month in one season or close enough? It would also keep the months as part of division hierarchy four seasons to a year three months to a season. As a consequence of this change the year also wouldnt start in the middle of winter. New Years Day can be the first day of spring. Edit Based on some of the responses Ive been getting it seems like a lot of places use the term season more colloquially with summer just meaning when the days are longer and warmer rather than the space between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox. To clarify this latter meaning is the one Ive going by. Harvest hunting basketball and tourist seasons are all regional but the ones that relate to axial tilt are universal as far as I can tell. School and financial years are misaligned with calendar years. Why have the school year when one could make the entire year line up with the calendar? This one has been answered Financial years have no set times and school years vary too much by region to try to align them with a universal calendar. iew changed in this respect. These are the three particular objections I have. To change my view explain why these problems are necessary or at least why fixing them would cause other problems apart from the practicality of adopting a new system to begin with. I am well aware that actually getting the world to adopt a new calendar is highly impractical but such practical concerns are beside my point so I dont intend to argue about that. Im also not going to bother with appeals to tradition. So change my view. Theres been some confusion regarding my intentions here. I am well aware that the costs of switching calendars would be huge and not worthwhile for the relatively small benefits of having a more consistent system. However if I allowed for that consideration when constructing my post I wouldnt have bothered to post it because my view would have already been changed. The basic question Im interested in is this are there good reasons to have any of the inconsistencies that the Gregorian calendar currently has? If we were to make a calendar from scratch is there any reason to have irregular months rather than regular ones? Is there any reason to have the year start in the middle of winter rather than changing at the same time as a new season? These are the parts of this that I want to hear about not whether it can be implemented. If it helps you focus on the matter at hand heres a rephrase I have a button that once pressed will retroactively switch the current calendar to one with the fixes I describe above. This change is instant seamless and will carry no cost apart from the effort to press the button. onvince me not to press it. ',\n 'Ill define a financial abortion as Giving up the parental rights to a child you fathered. It involves not having to pay child support. Ive seen this concept floating around and initially dismissed it completely as guys wanting to shirk responsibility and be deadbeats. I also thought it could be too easily exploited especially if men got cold feet about having a baby and after claiming to support the woman decided to screw her over by taking the financial abortion option. However Ive thought up ways in which such a law could actually be feasible. . If intending to get child support from the father of a child the woman UST inform him as soon as possible about the state of her being pregnant at least by the th week. aybe he can sign a document saying he knows shes pregnant. . The father can only decide to opt out and have the financial abortion up until the th week of pregnancy. If he doesnt opt out by then he loses the right to opt out. The week thing is because pregnancy is pretty obvious by then but the womans body hasnt been morphed much it looks like. This can be changed I just based it off looking at pictures. These laws mean that a woman can decide with plenty of time left over for contemplating abortion if she wants to keep a baby and raise it as a single mom. If she cant raise it on her own she might want to abort with no great medical risk compared to the risks of pregnancy. I think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it. I think it is also immoral to force a man to pay for a child he didnt want. If a woman cant raise the child without the fathers support the moral thing to do would be to abort the child. This law would obviously be relying on abortion being freely available in the area. It would probably be a very bad idea to implement it in the South of the USA for example. So that this law is feasible. I would like people to discuss loopholes extenuating circumstances and also if this law would be unfair to women in any way. I would also REALLY appreciate it if people explained why they think this is distasteful along with their down vote. Frankly Im sure people will find problems with this OIE THE. ',\n 'Hi there.

Im a year old white guy and straight Ive been single for about years now and before that I was in a relationship for and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point I dont know how best to describe it my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about months but its hard to remember all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had other girls on the go the whole time. I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. Aw dont worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? where among the comments she got and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil. But it isnt just her that has skewed my view on woman. y mother died when I was and me and my older brother where raised by just my dad. As difficult a child I was he did the best job he could with me. It wasnt until about that he met Helen. She was a early something year old nurse that lived about miles away. She would come down every few weeks to see my dad and spend time with me and my brother. We knew right away that something was wrong with her but being so young we couldnt put our finger on it. After a few more months my dad asked us if it would be OK if she stayed with us all the time and move in of course we didnt object because we could tell in the sound of his voice that he was lonely. aybe he should have know better or maybe his heart was so desperate for love that he couldnt see that she was a fussy child that thought the universe revolved around who knows? So when she moved in with us it was less than months before she wanted to get a house that belongs to them and we were in a new home. I stayed with them until I was and I moved in with my best friend and my girlfriend and I was glad to be gone. y dad had always been very firm but fair with us never angry or over the top. As soon as we got in to the new house it all changed. It turns out that she didnt want to pay any of the mortgage that had been taken out in both their names. This lead to them arguing all the time. She it seemed just wanted to go to work come home relax and go shopping and housework on the weekends only. I dont think that Oh God its because she a woman that she is so lazy and wont take responsibility! because it turns out that she was still living with her mum when she came to live with us and her mother still did everything for her. ake her meals clean her clothes and didnt take any sort of rent from her. She was a stubborn teenager in an adults body. Now fast forward about years she cheats on my father and moves back into her mums house. y dad also fell into another depression and stopped eating this time and starting drinking. It brought me to tears the first time I saw him a month after she left he looked like a skeleton and he didnt even have the ability to smile. He told me that he got a letter from a solicitor of hers say that she wanted half of what the house they got was worth about I think even though she never paid a penny in to it. Its been sorted now and she is gone for good but over all this time I was losing more and more respect for woman. Then there is the only friend I have right now being controlled by his girlfriend. He has a son with his last girlfriend who also cheated and left him in dept funnily enough and I have to say that he is the most incredible father youve ever met in your life. His son loves him to bits and is so well behaved and respectful to him nothing like I was when I was his age. He sees him times a week and has him every other weekend he sees his family goes to parks and zoos and whatnot he gets along with everyone he loves life and daddy. The mother on the other hand while providing him with everything he needs and Im sure she is a brilliant mother to him has decided to move in with her new boyfriend in a new house about miles away and there isnt anything my friend can do about it. The mother doesnt seem to care too much Hell make new friends you can see him through Skype newboyfriend will be a father figure for him and yes she actually said that. He broke down into tears with this he loves his son more than anything in the world and to be told by the mother that you cant see him as much and being powerless to stop it just fuels more of this sexist view I carry. The mother is moving at the start of the new year and she hasnt told her son and wont let my friend do it either or I will just tell him that you knew he was going all along and that you didnt tell him. Im on the phone to him most nights trying my best to make him feel better however I can but believe it or not he only talks about his son moving away half the time. The other half is about how unsupportive his current girlfriend is being. Now she is only and she probably doesnt know how to support someone going through this. To be honest I dont know how either but Im trying my best. From what he tells me she is just tired of him constantly going on about it and not even trying to cheer up. She is the same as Helen is some respects lives with boyfriend who pays most of the bills always gets driven to and from work which his dad got for her and hates it when he spends a bit of money on something nice for himself. She very much has the Whats mine is mines and whats is yours is mine attitude with everything they have. Shes spoilt selfish and is making an already horrid situation worse by having a shitty attitude about it. She did the same on my birthday party a few weeks ago. We were all having a drink and dancing and having a good time when suddenly Why are you looking at that girls arse? comes from her mouth and the night was downhill from there. We all spent a few hours trying to get her to calm down but she was having none of it her night had been ruined because he saw him staring at some other girl. Later in the night he punched him in the face but he couldnt do anything about it. He wasnt willing to tell some coppers we walked pasted because we knew she would lie and say it was the other way round and that she was the one who was punched or whatever leading him into trouble as Reddit keeps reminding me happens all the time. Wow this is far too long. But all of these experiences combined make me look down on woman in general as just overgrown children. Plus stories on the front page are always woman screwing men over by lying then getting away with it just add fuel to the fire. Its like a quote from Louis .K aybe I need more female friends maybe I needed a strong female role model in life but I need to change this toxic view I have. TLDR. Ive had one too many bad experiences involving woman in my life and I hate the fact I cant trust one and find it difficult to respect them. For the love of God Im begging you please help me change my view. ',\n 'I was just in a thread about how someones work blocked reddit and I thought good.

IF YOURE READING THIS POST AND YOU HAE NOT FINISHED AATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER AS WELL AS THE FOURTH BOOK OF LEGEND OF KORRA LIKE WHY? YOU KNOW THERES GONNA BE SPOILERS. ITS YOUR FAULT. STOP OR BE SORRY. Okay. aybe this is shitty of me as a person. aybe Im just closedminded and white cisgendered homophobic I hope Im not but hey. But I seem to be one of the like three total fans of Legend of Korra that did not think the series ended the way it should have. Throughout the entire four seasons nearly every character underwent such major development. ako used to be a selfish asshole who only cared for his brother and probending but at the end of the series he was an independent but caring detective who actively contributed to the safety of not only Republic ity citizens but the entire Earth Kingdom. Bolin was an immature kid but at the end of the series he was a matured public speaker who fought for love and for his country. And Korra most of all was a childish uncultured selfimportant bender who didnt know what being the Avatar meant but at the end of the series up until as close as three minutes before the end was an independent mature woman who had learned so much about what it meant to be the Avatar on a global scale. The finale however wherein she is canonically as of tonight romantically matched with Asami a seemingly minor female character completely devalued all character development for her and wrapped up the show in the absolute worst way. . To pair Korra a seemingly strong female character with anyone at all would not do her justice. Avatar Korra is a strong independent Water Tribe woman who dont need no man or uh girl. She broke up with ako in the second season because she couldnt be with him and be Avatar at the same time which is a theme consistent with The Last Airbender Aang had to let go his earthly tethers to enter the Avatar State. The difference for Aang was that there was a whole three seasons of tension between him and Katara so it was possible for it to happen naturally whereas there was at most being very generous half of a season of very vague and ambiguous um hey I like u for Korra. Even if Korra and ako or Bolin had gotten together at the end I dont think Id have been as happy as if Korra went on being the Avatar as the strong woman she was made out to be. . To pair Korra with a relatively minor character who was only significant when it was convenient to the team regardless of gender is objectively bad fiction. I dont hate Asami as a character and I dont hate them being paired because theyre both girls and ew yuck same sex. I hate the situation because Asami Sato didnt exist for half of the first season. When she started existing it was to foil Korra which was fine and actually good conflict at the time. Then when its discovered her dad Hiroshi Sato was an Equalist and a villain she joined Team Avatar fulltime. She and ako and Korra have had romantic conflict since season two but Asami was barely important in season three and slightly more important in season four. I say slightly important and not completely unimportant because she was relevant whenever Team Avatar needed a hiding spotbase of operations a plot weapon or transportation. But seriously arrick ended up being more important to the plot that Asami and he wasnt even really Team Avatar for three entire seasons. . There is no way this ending wasnt fanservice. This show is the sequel to Avatar The Last Airbender a mature show that the fans called for a sequel to. The first season ended in a murdersuicide. The second season finale completely changed the world of Avatar forever. The third season ended on a terrifying cliffhanger. The fourth and final season finale? Avatar Korra the most powerful bender on the planet and Asami Sato one of the two most intelligent minds on the planet the other being on honeymoon go on vacation in the Spirit World and get romantically involved. While Republic ity Zaofu and the Earth Kingdom en masse are in ruins akos and somewhat Bolins plots are left almost completely unresolved The new Earth King is considering radically changing the structure of the Earth Kingdom the New Air Nation is left nearly forgotten and literally every possible way to end the series logically was unresolved. What!?This relationship is copouty bad writing if it were with anybody literally anyone on the cast but being its the only other female character of any importance makes it that much worse. And its so out of left field! It feels like a fucking fan fiction! Its almost like the directors didnt even care to build to the reveal. Oh and theyre lesbians surprise. THE END. Why wouldnt they just end the series with a TenzinKorra mentorstudent moment or a KorraFather moment or even a tiny reference to Aang and the Gaang or anything other than the new forced relationship between Korra and Asami? Why end the series with a relationship at all?! Not to mention how awkward and ambiguous they had to make it to make it P enough for Nickelodeon. ugh... Please change my view and make me see how this awkward and seemingly rushed homosexual relationship between Korra and a main character is the best possible resolution for the show. I want to love this show again. Ive been with Avatar since I was in eight grade and loved all of it until the finale of the last season. Not to mention the fandom fucking exploded with a ton of OG DAE FORSHADOWING FOR EERY SEASON LOOK THEY OBIOUSLY LOE EAH OTHER posts. I cannot fucking stand people devaluing the show entirely as Korras coming out story because she was fighting her sexuality throughout the final season. That shit happened with Frozen and I wouldnt hear it so it infuriates me that this point of view has a foothold thanks to the writers. I refuse to believe that the writers of such amazing fiction in the past would resort to okay now we want you to hate the show so we dont have to do more. I want to see the light dammit. And to clarify I dont care that theyre les or bi or what the fuck ever. I hate that my opinion is automatically devalued as HOOFOB NOOOOO by the vast majority of the ATLA and ALOK subreddits not to even mention Tumblr. Sorry this is long. ',\n 'I support transsexual and transgender rights but I feel like this defense when used sometimes and under some circumstances does hold water. In short this is the trans panic defense also used for gays but I think that gay is much different than trans when it comes to this topic and for the sake of this I will not defend the gay panic defense  I think that it can be a valid response to rape by deception this was the case in Scottland.  The rape by deception rule has been used in the US. Just not on trans people.  Here is a more organized point of view If a trans person commits fraud rape and the person snaps in a heat of passion another legal defense then the trans panic defense should at the very lest be a mitigating factor. The reason behind this is that I believe that it is a reasonable assumption to have a heat of passion or temp. insanity against a person who did not disclose that they are indeed a man or a woman. Who honestly besides ERY open minded people would be ok with being tricked into sex with someone who was the same sex. I dont think the average person would be. hange my view iew changed.

Of course since reversible processes dont actually occur in nature they can only be approximated quasistatically. However to me it doesnt seem implausible that future engineers would be able to build a machine which only negligibly increases its own entropy by utilising approximately isentropic processes. This situation would be further facilitated by the fact that the density of the universe is low in a heat death scenario as such it would be difficult for the machine to increase entropy via interactions with the environment. Think of it like this we absolutely cannot bring humans to the speed of light with current technology. Its physically impossible. Humans are made up of massive particles. You know all this. However its plausible that future engineers might be able to design crafts that are fit to carry humans at . the speed of light. lose enough for all intents and purposes. In fact we can already build machines which do this for single particles. Similarly we absolutely cannot decrease the entropy of a closed system. Its almost physically impossible. But it doesnt seem implausible that future engineers might be able to build machines that are efficient enough to approximate processes with zero net entropy increase. Perhaps they could get close enough for all intents and purposes? Note that the lifetime of the hypothetical machine need not be infinite since stars could plausibly be regenerated by the Poincare Recurrence Theorem or the Fluctuation Theorem If somehow conciousness could be uploaded to a machine like this then I would argue that weve survived the heat death of the universe.

',\n 'edicine and its adminastration should not be marketed on tv because it is not the sort of product that the average consumer can make an informed decision about from a commerical. A car or a paper towel has attributes than can be discussed in a commerical in a way that the consumer can understand. They use commericals to inform consumers as to why the product is a better choice than the competition by discussing what is done differently. edicine is not marketed by talking about what chemicals are in it relative to the competition rather they show clips of patients enjoying life while listing a crapload of deadly side effects. Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine. Yes it is also true that doctors get the final say it is only with there perscription that a purchase of medication can be authorized so then I ask why do we need the commercial in the first place? Why not just send doctors a brochure of the latest in medication? There is also an arguement to be had for the vote with your dollar concept of capitalism but in my view medicine is exempt from this because no one wants to have to buy medicine and no one who is not a doctor is qualified to say which medication is better as well as the fact that most consumers are not going to try a variety and medicines and keep buying that which they like the best as is the case with shampoo or food. To me commercials for medicines are a shameless way for pharma companies to plug something and make money. Pharma should not be about profit but results. The fact that the commercials are legal seem indicative of a dangerous trend of profit before well being that is present the industry. ! ',\n 'The real problem is the concept of marriage itself.

',\n 'I havent really thought this out heavily but Ill do my best to make a proper case for myself and I actually would like to see it from anothers perspective. So here goes Having bought a game on one platform its not immoral to pirate the same game on another platform. Im not even really talking legally though feel free to inform me but wether I am negatively influencencing the victim companys with this. This of course excludes remakes GOTY editions and other versions that add substantially to the game assuming you own the vanilla version. This does not include better graphics on P or Keyboardmouse support.By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product solely because the rivalery of companies Sony icrosoft Nintendo prevents crossbuy. Expanding on my personal buying behaviour percent of the time I wouldnt have rebought the game anyway and am doing it purely for convenience bought on Xbox torrenting on laptop so I can play it when Im gone too so the developerconsolecompany wont make a loss on my illigal copy and the other of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for P for say the mods which are fully made by people outside the company and do so for no profit and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox and bought Fable TL in a Steam sale for so I could play it again with mouse keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on P I wasnt interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore I wouldnt have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already. You could argue that in theory I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think thats a risk you take when youre selling your machine at a loss and if that business model doesnt work for you change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very very low and is but a minor dent in the tenhundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldnt be buying their consoles anyway if it wasnt for their exclusives which as the name suggests are exclusive to that console. Along with that pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the machinedeveloper middle man and makes the loss go directly to the game developer. I think thats pretty much it I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it feel free to use those of course. Also I do apologise if this has been asked before I did a quick search before posting and found nothing. aybe my arguments make for a different approach to the case.

When people talk about rappers being deep I laugh most of the time. Especially if they cite Tupac. There are plenty of examples given from rappers who are very conscious and clever but even those hardly ever say anything I feel holds a candle to good lyrics from other genres. omparing it to actual poetry I feel is a very immature argument and usually made by people who never read actual poetry. Also as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument. Singing takes years to learn well enough to do in public but most people can jot down some typical rap lyrics with ease and learn to recite them over a beat pretty easy. ase in point Eazy E became a famous rapper even touring the white house doing something he was terrible at. And rightfully so because you can be a terrible rapper and still sell a ton of records and actually be considered great at what you do and that does not apply to other forms of music. ',\n 'Ive been thinking about this for a while. There are serious parallels between the Great Gatsby and HipHop culture. Both portray their main characters as being born from poverty and progressing to riches only through disregard of their morals chasing money. Illmatic a hiphop classic is full of references to this part of hiphop culture. Is like a maze full of black rats trapped says Nas in the famous NY state of mind. The next track Lifes a bitch goes further into this mentality isualising the realism of life in actuality fuck whos the baddest a persons status depends on salary. Another classic hiphop song .R.E.A.. resigns to this fact as Gatsby does ash rules everything around me. The racism aspect is also clear Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon and at the airport they check all through my bags and tell me its random but we stay winning This is also where the stereotypical hate for the police comes from. Nas in a song about the crushing poverty where he grew up emory Lane says No sign of the beast in the blue hrysler I guess that means peace. Even worse than the fellow black people trying to get out like Gatsby are the police trying to keep the Black rats in the trap. Judges hanging niggas incorrect bails for direct sales my intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails. The mentality of being born into a racist system trying to keep you down combined with the constant drumming into you what the American dream is motivates people to do terrible things. But I think that Hiphop deserves more attention and credit for being a modern day retelling of the flawed American Dream and Racist System and what happens when they meet. He see it as another felony drug arrest any day could be the day he picks the wrong thug to test slug through the vest shot in the street for pulling heat on a father whose baby gotta eat',\n 'So Ive been a regular reddit user for several years and one of the more controversial communities on here is SRS or ShitRedditSays. It highlights a range of content that is racist sexist or generally offensive that is regularly upvoted and validated by significant portions of the reddit community. Things that can and do reach the front pageor are tangentially connected to it through things like the comments of such threads. Now the largest complaint I see is that the community is a hate group which seems a bit silly to me. Who are they discriminating against? White ales? As far as I know thats what the majority of the community is composed of. Secondly often times the content they highlight are offensive jokes and these statements are defended with statements like its just a joke. This makes the accusation that SRS is a hate group to me even stranger given that the vast majority of the comments in the comment section tend to be similar jokes just at the expense of those who mocked the disadvantagedor and assumed image of them. an those who like making jokes at the expense of others not take what they dish out? Thirdly and probably most importantly SRS is in my view a very necessary force of balance. People like to say they are a force of censorship but I dont agree with that. First and foremost for all the complaints about brigading very few of the content they highlight is downvoted into obscurity. Beyond that Freedom of Speech is only guaranteed by the US Government but not by private companies like Reddit or massive populations like Reddits user base. Being downvoted isnt censorship. You expressed your sentiment and the community rejected it. Nothing was denied beyond validation. Reddit is an immensely useful medium and interface for connecting to people all over the world and it receives new users every day. When memes like Opinion Puffin basically degenerate into a way for people to seek validation for racist and sexist beliefs and this stuff gets upvoted to the front page from being on one of the sites most populated subs it can give the wrong idea as to what kind of community actually uses this site or give someone a good reason for not joining which is sad because social connection is exactly what Reddit was obviously designed to foster. Anyway those are my main reasons for my current position. Other stuff may come up in the discussion but this should be enough to at least get the ball rolling. For the sake of acknowledging the other side of this debate I do understand they have a history of doxxing that is controversial but my knowledge of those instances are pretty hazy so someone more familiar with what happened there can maybe shed some light on it that could change my view.

Prolife believe that life begins at conception and that adoption is a viable alternative for of cases and that tacit consent is valid for both the fetus and child support Pro gay marriage against hiring discrimination laws I believe they themselves are simply legalized discrimination To put it concisely I am probably a moderate contrarian here. I guess as Ive gotten older Ive found myself being more moderate than liberal or conservative and really feel like Ive come full circle politically. And I honestly believe that my younger views probably were nearly identical to the hive minds. That being said when I was posting years ago with the hive mind mentality never.... never was it about censoring dissenting opinions. I and many of my fellow posters were always willing to go to GREAT lengths to try and persuade someone to join our side. What Ive noticed lately is that is not only no longer the case but there is a considerable amount of tattle tailing in the form of people getting doxxed content being reported to mods comments being deleted and even well intentioned posts being deleted. Recently several old posts of mine were removed from another user name. This was a post that didnt contain any homophobia but was critical of some parts of the gay movement. Do remember I support the right to gay marriage and I respect and understand the plight that many gay people go through. But some of the arguments I feel are hypocritical impractical or lack merit. The same thing I would do to any argument involving straight rights I want to expose what I believe to be faulty logic. Using  You can see a considerable number of dissenting but respectful posts removed from almost any thread. I find it not only unsettling but bizarre that even mild critique or dissenting opinions are considered radical or extreme and that there seems to be support that an opinion should be censored. Then invariably the reply is freedom of speech not from consequences. That still doesnt change anything its censorship plain amp simple.',\n 'With the minimum replacement rate standing at . babies per woman and the current birth rates of many nations being as low as . this leads to an ageing population that produces many ill effects for the countries and their economies. The most obvious problem is the funding of the social services. With more old people needing pensions and healthcare and with less young people to finance that the system will inevitably collapse. There are two solutions that I know of. Increased immigration to close the gap and ways to encourage couples to have more kids through tax breaks and the like. The other one that I heard being touted is that very soon we will be living in a post scarcity society and that population decrease will not have any consequences but I dont believe that it is feasible. ',\n 'Ive been angry about the setup of the US penal system for a long time for being a system of punishment instead of rehabilitation. Especially when so many inmates are nonviolent drug offenders. Shit what are you supposed to do when your job doesnt pay you enough to eat? Starve and be homeless? So many people have been incarcerated for refusing to give up trying to get by. Anyways getting off my soapbox as the mods have requested Id rather spend life in prison than years behind bars. After years you get thrown back into the real world as an older man with no skills probably no family and not a chance that someone will hire you. You know nothing but prison. If you werent a hardened criminal before you sure are now and society will do nothing to help you aside from sending you back to a hole. In the current system there is nothing for these people after years. At least in prison you get meals and shelter instead of being thrown onto the street. y ramblings have been inspired by two homeless men I drive to a shelter. They want to be sent back to prison. I think the penal system we have does more harm than good and that tossing inmates back into society after decades of imprisonment is inappropriate to the degree that it is almost a human rights violation. Id really like to hear why it isnt. ',\n 'When I say movie and movie industry I am only expressing movies with real life actors. I see more prevalent diversity and creativity in cartoons and anime. With every new movie I feel as though I have seen it before. This sense grows with every movie. I appreciate the subtle tricks directors throw in here and there to tilt the angle of the audiences perception of the scene. This is the beauty of the art of filmmaking. However I do not appreciate the redundancy of obvious filming tricks that seem to slip by others while I see them as cutcopy. I loathe actors. I think the acting paradigm is stale because of the way the movie industry operates recycling the same actors and suppressing the unique to guarantee another successful movie. Im also greatly disturbed by the way people rate movies. People never have an accurate critique on whether the movie was good or bad. I believe their decision of the movies goodness is based on things unrelated to the movie itself such as preset confirmation bias due to certain actors or directors associated with the film confirmation bias due to a friends review group think or even intruding mood. ',\n 'I think that if two people get married and choose to hyphenate their namesmeaning r. iller and s. Johnson become the Johnsonillers or if they choose to each keep their names their children should still only be named after one parent. I dont think its really a problem in individual instances but I also think that proponents of the system havent thought through how this would play out over generations if such a system becomes widely adopted. When r illerJohnson meets s FranklinStevens do their kids get get named Bobby and Susie illerJohnsonFranklinStevens? Or do we start arbitrarily deciding which grandparents names to lop off? Seems like that conversation would be pretty uncomfortableoffensive. Sorry grandma Johnson and Grandpa Stevens you didnt make the grandkids name cut. See you at hristmas! I dont think either is as good a system as every child inheriting a single last name. I would legitimately like someone to change this view because I see the current system as really patronizing to women and I dont like saying other people should or shouldnt be naming their own children however they want but it just doesnt seem like the hyphenate is a sustainable solution to me. ',\n 'Now I do not consider myself to be an unhappy person. Things are actually pretty good for me. I come from a pretty good background with parents who care about me and relatives who love me. I have many opportunities. That being said I think never have being born would have been much better. The joy I feel doesnt outweigh the anxiety I have towards death. Since we are beingstowarddeath we leave in anticipation of it. Its inescapable. Not being born means not feeling anything and not feeling anything means not feeling pain and pain is a stronger emotion than happiness. As Sartre puts it We are condemned to be free. Id rather not be condemned in the first place. Freedom is the product of condemnation to be subject to existence. Freedom means nothing if you dont want it. Please .',\n 'So as an American sortatransplant to anada and a law nerd I get a decent amount of flak for my very American views on civil rights laws. Specifically I am a really big fan of superstrong free speech and free press laws as well as really strong due process rights and am very critical of many anadian legal institutions which dont seem to respect these. The biggest problem I have is with the anadian harter of Rights and Freedoms and specifically with Section and Section . Section reads Section reads These two and particularly Section gut the charter of any meaningful protection for civil liberties in anada. Section has been used to fine people for handing out political pamphlets. It has been used to deny people freedom to travel. It has been used to establish quasi judicial bodies which do not have due process of law. Section called the notwithstanding clause lets the government exempt any law from the harter on its own sayso. Quebec used this to implement incredibly strong restrictions on speech in languages other than French. The Oakes test used by anadian courts to determine if a violation of constitutional rights under Section can be permitted is incredibly weak. Under Oakes the government must show that . The infringement is rationally related to a government objective. . The impairment of rights has to be as little as is reasonably possible and this one keeps creeping up used to be minimal impairment. . There must be proportionality between the infringement and the objective. In contrast in the US a restriction on free speech like in the Whatcott case above would be subject to strict scrutiny To meet the strict scrutiny standard the restriction must . Be justified by a compelling government interest. The reason for the restriction has to be something the government has to do not merely something they want to do. . Be narrowly tailored to that interest. That is the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do. . Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest. That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question. The Supreme ourt of the US took on a case of much more hateful antigay speech than the Whatcott case right around the same time. That opinion sums up the US attitude to speech pretty well speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. All my anadian friends think this Im crazy for agreeing with this and wanting to allow people like the Westboro church who were the people in that case to speak freely. hange my view.

Obviously this is disingenuous crude and ignorant. Native American or American is no better however when considering the origination of the term. For those unaware The americas have been given this current title from the ItalianSpanish explorer amerigo vespucci. He likely has less of a claim to name of this massive land than even olumbus though Im sure no one with any current knowledge of this explorer would keep the name Native olumbian and is simply famous because held he the quill when forging the map. In either case we are claiming these indigenous people have no right to the original names they held such as tribe like navajo and apache and are required to be labeled as what the current foreigners see as fitting. Some native americans may agree with this term but this has little to do with it being agreeable nomenclature and instead is a lesser of the evils in comparison to Savage Featherhead and now presently Redskin.

I would like to see the counter argument to my views so that I can objectively reanalyze my stance on them and decide if I still feel this way. I was referred here by another poster and Ive read through the rules and it seems like the perfect sub for a good debate . That being said I dont understand why its inappropriate to use profanity or even for children to be exposed to or even use profanity. Swear words are literally just words and most of them are considered slang or profanity since they originated from the AngloSaxon words. I do not allow my children to swear but every time that I tell them not to I feel like a hypocrite. The only reasons I dont allow them to swear is because I dont want them to get into the habit then let a swear word slip at school and end up in trouble. Society seems to really look down on children using profanity so I also dont want an investigation from DF or anything like that. I understand that some people find them offensive from a religious standpoint but as a non religious person myself this doesnt apply to me and I dont feel like its a good antiprofanity argument since it doesnt coincide with my morality. y moral code is simple does this action harm another individual in some way? If so analyze the action and determine if the fault lies in the action or the person being harmed by it. Someone taking offense to profanity falls in the category of just because youre offended doesnt make you right. hange my view? ',\n 'Baby boomers are often referred to as the e generation mainly because they tend to vote only in their own best interests. Such as siding with the right so they wont have to pay income taxes for things they wont specifically benefit from. But when they say theyd like to cut entitlement programs they probably mean after theyre done collecting their social security checks. And with their retirement funds not accounting for inflation it wont keep them at the standard of living theyd become accustomed to. Theyll not only vote to keep entitlements going I wouldnt be surprised if they demanded more. The increasingly large percentage that wont have retirement to fall back on at all will likely need to live with one of their children who may or may not be willingable to support them. Sure theyll be able to live in retirement communities but theyll fill up fast and will drop in quality because of the increased demand for resources. And with so many grown children being unable to pay for better options the boomers will have to turn to the government for assistance. This generation will also be requiring more healthcare than ever in their lives. The boomers will demand lower prices better quality and will encourage as much regulation as possible. Itll probably be the thing that leads to universal healthcare. Yes in the end I believe even the boomers that will say theyre republican will probably cast democratic votes to save face. Itll lead to more leftleaning policies and a possible reinvigoration of the poor and middle class. Itll also probably lead to higher income taxes which will make the next generations very rightwing.

When sales wasnt the focus the corporate side of the organization seemed disinterested in support for campinghiking trips adult leaders needed many certifications before you could do these activities or anything that didnt involve pushing for higher numbers during the next sales drive. This wasnt as much the case in Boy Scouts but it was certainly becoming more a focus than in years past. It seems to me that what once was a strictly volunteer organization with few full time organizers has become a very big corporate entity as of the s which has lost focus on child development and put more of it on profiteering off of the very children they are meant to inspire. I want to stress that since a large corporate structure was essentially unnecessary and then a shift happened as of the s which began a massive change in both organizations from the top. I understand the need for a national organization to make sure that standards are met materials such as books and badges are produced and camps are managed. I just think that was once managed by relatively small numbers of individuals whos salaries were likely below K a year have been replaced with a large corporation with salaries that are hidden but most certainly well above K annually and who enjoy an extra cozy and sheltered status with the government.

It is often framed as something along the lines of even good people are easy to corrupt and manipulate into evil. But the average person is not necessarily good or bad. The truth is that most people when thinking of what is right and wrong do not decide on ethical principles and then reason outwards from those principles. Rather they learn which behaviours are and arent acceptable through social interaction and any intellectual engagement with morality is merely finding reasons justifying their moralperceptual status quo. This is philosophy reduced to mere rationalisation. We can see moral pioneers in people like Bentham and ill both of whom anticipated relatively modern moral concerns such as womens equality under the law animal welfare and the thencontemporary issue of slavery. These people came to egalitarian conclusions at least one hundred years before feminism and the animal liberation movement.

When he first told me he was somewhat vague. and my initial understanding was the he got roofied by his very best friend during a sleep over and then either raped or heavily molested judging by his extremely traumatized condition. He said he felt betrayed violated slutty. Everything youd expect to hear from a rape victim. I immediately advised him to get away from that friend the rapist. And hes been talking about it a lot actually not that I mind I was and still as supportive as i can.

It was just a wild guess. He probably just got sleepy according to my friend the victim and when he woke up his friend was simply half naked and cuddled with him. Thats it. Im trying to support my friend whos majorly depressed about it. But honestly I cant take him seriously anymore. I mean I understand this might count as sexual harassment. But its not that huge.

',\n 'Obviously police reform is on the table right now in light of the past few weeks. Ive read things about body cams and increased accountability all placing a taller order for officers. ost of it to me comes off as basic cop hating and doesnt actually provide a reasonable solution that improves the amount of corrective justice taking place. In fact it impedes the justice system because it introduces external hoops for police to jump over doing their job. y arguments are as follows Increasing police accountability increases police liability. In the era of social media one bad experience can cost you your whole career. This is true for every job BUT its exceptionally true for police who on a day to day basis subject themselves to this form of public scrutiny. I dont see this going away under the current status quo but I do think that adding more barriers to this particular issue destroys something the general populous values. Job stability. . Becoming a police officer like any other form of training is an investment and the current state of affairs and the proposed state of affairs will diminish job stability for police officers. This results in a net negative in effective justice because less officers means more crime. . It will create an upward trend in the riskreward mentality. Due to their scarcity cops will eventually lead to higher compensations to incentivize the fields. This is something present in other fields already where scarcity for the position exists such as medical nurses having large signing bonuses. This leads to increased police spending for less officers once again creating a net negative for justice. . The proposed things Ive heard such as maiming instead of killing and body cams provide proper closure for a negligible amount of cases but create far more gaps in coverage than they are worth. So its logically inconsistent to say ake cops more accountable so we can have more true justice. Raising the liability of police officers and destroying police coverage because of this ideology is not a positive boon to the justice system. Yes more high profile cases are covered better but their frequency is too infrequent to justify the loss of police force. At which point if you insist on some of the measures suggested you are not for more justice you are just cop hating. Please . ',\n 'Everyone whether they are being truthful or not knows the consequences of accusing someone else of a crime. You know that they will probably be charged and you know the order of magnitude of punishment they will receive. Take a scenario where you knowingly wrongfully accuse someone of murder and they get the death penalty as a result. I would say that you murdered this person and therefore should be exposed to the death penalty yourself in trial. This seems to especially apply in cases of rape. While there are no doubt actual rapes that do occur. False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim row South where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations. This tradition continues today with cases like the University of irginia and this is what I believe and not the subject of this post Bill osby. A person making a legitimate accusation has nothing to fear but people would think twice before wrongfully accusing others. I have predicted the generic responses to my argument and will respond to them here. Rightful accusers would have something to fear if the person who victimized them gets away with their crime they will now face prosection This is a good point but I think that this can be solved by rethinking the way we choose juries. Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process regardless of the location of the trial the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions. This makes it very difficult to convict criminal archetypes like the college rapist or the malpracticing doctor. By introducing higher racial and socioeconomic diversity into juries we can eliminate the predictability of verdicts. The punishment is harsher than the crime. No it isnt. Killing someone is no different than setting a machine in motion that will result in them dying. Tricking the government into locking someone away for years is surely a capital offense and should be punished as such. The perjury charge handles this I believe that this is too weak it is not a capital offense and it should be. I am willing to change this view but it will take some level of convincing. I am eager to hear the responses. ODIFIATION OF Y IEW credit to uAereRedditor I now believe that the minimum sentence for the crime that the accuser was accused of is inappropriate but that the maximum sentence for the attempted version of the same crime is still very much appropriate. If you are found guilty of knowingly wrongfully accusing someone of murder your sentence should be the maximum for attempted murder ',\n 'Ive heard several times that the James Bond movies are sexist. While I havent seen them all mostly the Daniel raig and Pierce Brosnan ones criticism exists for all movies in this regard. Taking it from this article it seems their problem is the objectifiction of Bonds one night stands on the basis that he just sleeps with them and then forgets about them. But I dont see how that can be.considered objectification since both parties agree to have consensual sex and Bond never makes any hints on wanting to build a relationship. Just letting things happen. He does use the woman for sexual gratification but so does the woman with him. Theres no way one doesnt use someone as something if this is what they mean. Another point is that he is cold and uncaring towards his ONS getting killed but it seems this could be explained more succinctly through Bonds job hes a spy a trained soldier who is put in dangers way all the time to defend his country and that through the years he has become numb to death. He doesnt dwell on those deaths because it would be detrimental to his mission make him lose focus on his objective. This is probably something he has trained for.

So its no longer my view! Thanks for the good times guys!  ',\n 'y argument may come of as pretentious but I will do my best to present my view in a valid and logical way. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. It is a phrase all of us have used or heard most likely within the past few days. It is a phrase built to end arguments prevent yelling and provide a middle ground for those who simply can not agree. There are many cases that the phrase can be used for its intended purpose and remain harmless. One such case an argument is based SOLELY on opinion such as preference to chocolate or vanilla hot or cold red or blue. Another case is when an argument has continued through all other types of context and discourse that it has simply boiled down to a difference of opinion often dealing with some sort of sensory informationfeel taste smell etc.. Unfortunately the use of everyone is entitled to their opinion has shifted over time and is more often than not used in a visceral and spiteful manner. That is when the phrase becomes dangerous. The thought process behind the spiteful and lazy use of that phrase is what allowed cultures speaking mostly of the US because that is where I am from to slide away from a collective and productive entity and into a state of cyclical banter. y evidence of the danger of the phrase and the effect it has had on the culture is as follows . People use the phrase to lazily get out of arguments that are difficult or are in a field that they are not familiar with. They use the phrase to cover up their ignorance in order to protect their misconstrued beliefs. They will argue in circles for hours about something they dont know and justify the entire waste of brainpower as an opinion difference in order to move on with their lives without fracturing their beliefs. . The idea of being an expert on a topic is no longer valid. It is no longer valid because bits and pieces of info are so readily available individuals will allow themselves to feel they have enough information to form a strong belief without being an expert on the topic. The invaluable amount of time true experts spend in their fields hours according to the fantastic book Outliers by alcolm Gladwell is nullified by the amount of perceived expertise that is part of our current cultural climate. . Factual arguments that can be argued down to a relative truth within the context of the argument are no longer explored. Opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various newspropaganda organizations. The Everyone is entitled to their opinion mindset is the engine that drives the divide in cultural beliefs. No suitable and rational arguments are being made anymore because an OPINION is something that doesnt need to be changed as everyone is entitled to have one. There are many more examples that I will go into if needed. Essentially what I am saying is that the idea behind the phrase and the misuse of the phrase is an underlying cause of many of the political cultural and social issues that continue to exist year after yearwith many of them getting worse. The idea that everyone has an entitlement when it comes to opinions that affect beliefs is preposterous and dangerous. As a personal conclusion many of the points I made in the writeup and many of the points I will make in the comments are in fact hypocritical. I am not innocent in the claims that I am making so please help me not be as cynical and free me from my hypocrisy. !

',\n 'I would agree that we should not have this much surplus military equipment but without addressing that concern what else is the military to do with the equipment? Is it better to lock it up in boxes or sell it to foreign countries? Wont the government be able to squash and oppress the citizenry by using this equipment? The equipment is given to local police forces though and why would they all unite against their neighbors? I would argue the opposite that the equipment actually better arms the common man against the federal government. The best argument against militarization that Ive heard was in Dan arlins ommon Sense podcast Ep . He says just the optics of it are bad. If Fergusons black residents feel that the police are more like an occupying force than it is their neighbors protecting them adding tanks does not dispel that notion. While I agree that this point is good it does not have enough weight to it to justify throwing the equipment away selling it to other countries or leaving it in the federal governments hands.

',\n 'To elaborate I was in an argument over at rlibertarian over a quote from Ron Paul that was getting a lot of flak. I think that institutions and political efforts that act for the benefit of a specific race or for the promotion of so called diversity are inherently racist and reinforcing the problem. I understand what institutionalized racism is and how our cultures stereotypes can make it difficult for people of certain backgrounds to change the stereotypes in the first place i.e. a selffulfilling prophecy Yet I agree with Ron Paul in that ending these stereotypes is not a matter of actively promoting diversity or mandating changes to our system. Instead I believe that we have to provide absolutely equal opportunities to everyone regardless of race stop asking for it in the paperwork and stop teaching the racial stereotypes to our youth. In short I think we have to stop caring about race to stop caring about race. It seems that any opinion I hold is discounted by my race because I cant possibly understand the struggles of minorities which I find quite ironic as white is a minority in my town.

',\n 'I know this is a widely hated view in the gay community however I just cant help seeing the truth in it. So I am a firm believer in cultural relativism that you can not judge a culture base off of morals or societal norms you gained from your own culture. So we have example one that being gay is okay because we have seen it throughout history in many different cultures the Greeks being a prime example. However they also were constant offenders of pedophilia forcing twelve year old boys to give oral sex to grown men. We bring up pacific island cultures that idolize drag queens and transgenders however there are also cultures where the women teach the year old boys how to have sex. How can the first be okay but not the second. They are both acceptable in their respective cultures just one is deemed disgusting in our culture. We bring up animals point out how so many different species have gay relationships but animals also start having sex as soon as they are able to produce babies which is like twelve for us. Being gay is natural being a pedophile is natural we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the norm but are widely accepted in many cultures. However westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic hristians what they think about gay people they say its disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia when in truth they are very much alike. Before I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester I figured Id state my views. I am in full support of the gay community I have a gay sister that I love very dearly. I am in noway condoning or promoting pedophilia I too find it disgusting and wrong but understand that that viewpoint is a product of the society I grew up in. P.S. apologize for the hurt feeling I understand I could have worded the title a little bit better. ',\n 'Advance apologies for the length and possibly the perceived tone of this post for which I beg your indulgence. I tried to explain my position as clearly as I could and in cases like that my writing tends to take a decidedly formal swerve. Im aware that this carefully formal style may make me sound smug pompous or whatever other adjectives of oblivious selfinflation may apply. If anything I write strikes you that way Im sorry. I only ask you to keep in mind that it probably stems from love of precision and perhaps poor judgment of tone rather than from condescension. Background This topic is on my mind because its apparently been raised again recently in an episode of Aaron Sorkins The Newsroom and I just read in todays New York Times an article about the controversy that episode aroused It seems the episode involved a credible empathetic accuser and a sketchy offscreen accused so that the viewer automatically tends to give her story credence. Even so a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience without any conviction or trial. This seems to have aroused a huge backlash with articles published on Jezebel and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to victimblame a woman who was rapeddespite the fact that as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article he created this character to be a sympathetic alleged rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved. Another quotation from the NYT article Presentation of my views It seems to me that in discussions of this sort people persistently conflate not believing ones story with disbelieving ones story as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the oppositebut this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something and I dont have a good reason to believe one or the other my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted. oreover I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed uncorroborated things and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Furthermore even if for arguments sake one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sortviz. innocent until proven guiltywould remain vitally important because its abrogation in any case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone elses life while facing little or no potential negative impact him or herself. Summary of my views The views Im asking you to change if you can are . It is extremely difficult if not impossible to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation. . The protocol of innocent until proven guilty is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth how could it be? but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse. . A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage andor punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third most important possibility of all which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged. y biases I should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level an INTP personality type if you like the yersBriggs categorization system Furthermore Im a man and do not personally know any rape victims that Im aware of so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level which of course I do too I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation the position I can more readily imagine myself in than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice. Im aware of both these biases and of course like everything else in our world of matter and men my views are also subject to Newtons First Law which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held. And so... with those caveats in mind change my views please if you will any or all of them. Even if you dont succeed in changing them entirely Ill welcome any added perspective you can provide me and I believe Im open to that much at the very least. PS Support roles A number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of ideally neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a persons support system immediate family and close friends suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. Id tentatively agree with that with the proviso that Id apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim of rape or of slander. Id add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when theyre not acting on those beliefs in a way thats liable to directly cause harm to someone else.

But I also believe if you take a person who isnt corrupt and insert them into this same position of power they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them. I think teachers illustrate this point very well especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say the President of the United States. In this regard you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes at least with regards to daytoday activities. Generally if a teacher says to do something it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teachers superior. Taking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power and those who dont. If the saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely were true all teachers would abuse their power since it is the power that corrupts the person and not the person that corrupts the power. Parents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow or rules that have no legitimate reason other than because I say so. Im not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the because I say so justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason but sometimes parents dont actually have a reason other than I say so. However you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent and argues his or her case fairly there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If absolute power corrupts absolutely parents like the latter would not exist as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them. TLDR Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely.',\n 'Im basing this on my experience solely. Some of you might be completely different.

',\n 'First this is my first post to so I apologize if I do anything incorrectly. As a young student recently gaining the ability to vote I quite frankly have no idea what is going on in the modern political system. I see D and R democrats and republics I will just shorten them to D and R continuously arguing over topics that would not benefit the general public. Their reasons are often objectionable and I do not see why we continue to use this party system. I do understand that it would be an absolutely HUGE undertaking to redo this system and I am not advocating for an immediate change. For example net neutrality. What the hell is going on here? From what I understand we have ISP corporations paying government officials to pass laws or the such to benefit the ISP. That of which is an entirely different discussion So now we effectively have the ISPs vs the ones who didnt accept the money. What on earth? We didnt elect the ISPs. We elected representatives... People who are supposed to stand for the general public not a couple corporations. Additionally we all know Obama is pro neutrality. I have no opinion on Obama or his work. aybe I will after he finishes this term. But I see people opposing net neutrality SOLELY because Obama is for it. What? Youre willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesnt want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ? How can voters trust your party if you just go against another persons beliefs just because of who they are? If this whole ordeal repeatedly continues into other issues that we face in the future what does this mean for the citizens? It would effectively be run by whoever has more people in power and those people have a chance of being run by money sent to them by corporations. Additionally I often see that we are left with the choice of dumb vs dumber in elections. Why are the parties in charge of who represents them? ant we eliminate the parties and each candidate stands by his own beliefs not the partys and then we can elect someone the majority agrees with? . ',\n 'Simply put I dont see how we could decide which kinds of speech are acceptable under campaign finance laws. In the itizens United case there was a movie called Hillary The ovie. The District ourt judge thought that the movie had no purpose other than to discredit lintons candidacy for president. I havent seen the film but for the sake of argument I am willing to stipulate that ads for the film would look the same as the normal political attack ads we see every election cycle. I think the film was designed for this purpose So allowing films like that and ads for it in effect allows for unlimited political spending. ompare that film to Fahrenheit . itizens United had sued to have Fahrenheit found to violate campaign finance laws but the film was found to represented bona fide commercial activity and thus not be covered by such laws. Where do we draw the line? I could put together a movie with actual plot and themes and stuff taking place for an hour and the other half hour is material to cut attack ads out of. I could then run ads for the film which were in effect political attack ads. That film would be bona fide commercial activity but still be exploitable in the same way. If we dont allow unlimited political spending I cant picture a rule that would work. For a number of reasons I dont like the impact of unlimited political spending so please hange y iew!

',\n 'I will use the following labels for clarity A cheater B SO other person I firmly believe it is very wrong to cheat on your SO. It betrays trust breaks a serious commitment and shows a lack of respect. The ensuing lies are often as bad if not worse. However has no commitment to B. is not breaking trust or lying to B. NOTE None of this applies is friends with the B. Then is breaking trust and being an awful friend. Once A has made the choice that they are willing to cheat the damage is done. Whether or not A actually cheats at this point has no effect excluding STDs. I do not see any reason why B would be more upset to learn that A had cheated on himher than if B had refrained from doing so only because did not want to. I would not want to date someone who would have cheated on me if they could any more than I would want to date someone who actually did. Thus once A has made clear hisher intention or desire EDIT if this is a clear and conscious decision without outside influence to cheat on B is doing nothing wrong by going through with it. As a continuation I believe the right thing for to do is to inform B of As infidelity regardless. I do not necessarily think there is a responsibility for to do so though. However this is not central to my belief or to this post. ',\n 'I hold this belief because I believe that reddit as a site would be vastly improved by having a very active moderation team. Especially in light of the deaths of ichael Brown and Eric Garner I have seen tons of people throwing around slurs and comparing black people to monkeys among other things. I also believe that the admins should ban subreddits that are based on hate speech such as rwhiterights rgreatapes. In addition admins should ban subreddits that promote violence against women such as rtheredpill and rbeatingwomen. I can anticipate a lot of the responses Ill get so Ill address some counterarguments right now. This allows the admins to abuse their power and ban nonracistsexistprejudice subreddits. I believe that in order for reddit to ban a subreddit they should have to explain why it was banned and give evidence that it was promoting hate speech. This censors free speech. Reddit is a private company that can do whatever they want legally. Anyone who wants to be racist could go to Stormfront or any other forum that tolerates hate. Where will the mods draw the line between satire and seriousness? This is actually a good point and I think it would be tricky. riamgoingtohellforthis is a subreddit that I frequent and even though there is a lot of awful shit on there I think most of it is satire and not problematic. Again I believe that giving the admins discretion over what they do is important because theyre not stupid and they know what subreddits are actually racist. On a similar note I also believe that subreddits that have a large number of racistsexist users but does not promote hate speech as a whole should not be banned. An example of this would be rmensrights. I believe that even though a large number of users there are sexist the purpose of the sub is simply bringing attention to mens issues. ',\n 'This argument applies to any allergen but for the sake of simplicity we will argue the specific case of peanuts. y view is that since nobody who frequently visits my house has a peanut allergy it is not my job to avoid mixing in peanuts with other foods. I came up with this idea when I was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I wanted to spread the peanut butter first but I realized that by spreading peanut butter and then using the same knife in the jelly I would be adding peanuts to the jelly. However I then thought that I shouldnt have to worry about this because it is my house my jelly and my nonallergy. . ',\n 'Ive thought this for a long time and the recent surge in media awareness has brought this idea to the forefront of my mind. Resisting arrest is currently a felony offense in multiple states USA.. but anecdotally the charge is used to basically trump up the offenses committed by the perp. For those of you who are unaware it is still a felonyagainst the law to resist an unlawful arrest meaning that as a citizen obeying the law in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you and you arent even allowed to flinch. I think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. Now Im not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force but there needs to be some protection for civilians resisting in a reasonable fashion. That may not be the perfect wording or solution but its coming from a layman. so the problem is deeper than policy its the psychology involved with the entire arrest procedure. y mind is still set that USA arrests and policing are ripe with abuse but the root is not these laws its the people and traditions. Id still like to see more protection for civilians but allowing resisting arrest probably isnt the right avenue a new generation of judges may be more lenient towards it but thats a different story. I cant remember the policy on giving out deltas but youre points were very clear. Especially when you circled back to its a problem with individual officers not the system while I agree that the officer is obviously the main factor I think there is a systemically induced fear on both sides which is not addressed and maybe even escalated by allowing civilians to resist. ',\n 'I first learned about evolution as a young child. y father immediately informed me that evolution was false for religious reasons. y entire analysis of evolution has been based on the idea that macroevolution is false. With this in mind after discussing Darwin and evolution at a high school level I formulated a view that I still hold to this day. Evolution occurs on small scales with species but these species do not hold a common ancestor. I cannot say for certain how many species of birds existed at the beginning but I certainly accept that there are more species now because species adapt and natural selection takes hold. I do not believe however that humans are direct descendents of any species and I do not believe that birds and dogs for example had any common ancestor. In forming this belief I have rejected certain levels of scientific consensus but I have never rejected any information that I felt refuted this. In any case what I am looking for are examples that prove that a dog may have had the same ancestor as a bird or something along those lines. I am not looking for the only facts that I have been offered that finches in the Galapagos developed different beaks. ',\n ' Inspired from the link above. If you cant see it its a picture of a woman taken in new york with the caption that she only believes her hair and hands to be beautiful. Unsurprisingly the thread has been inundated with comments from people most of them women telling her that she is being too hard on herself that she is gorgeous that she should appreciate youth and other platitudes. While I get that these people are coming from a good place I dont think its the right thing to do for the following reasons. Its ultimately very condescending. What the commenters are saying when they say Youre wrong youre beautiful!!!!! is that is in capable of objectively analyzing herself and that she has to defer to strangers for that information that she cant discern for herself. I think its very clear to her that she is not a runway model and that she is a little obese so trying to tell her that she cant see herself properly in the mirror comes off more as an insult or a youre just saying that to make me feel better moment. I also think that its a good thing when people can look at themselves in an objective way. ery few people face their own flaws and never do anything about them because they are fed this love yourself no matter what BS so they go on with a bad personality or a bad diet and never wonder what they are doing wrong but instead blame other people Or in this case the media for their problems. I can appreciate people who see the flaws in themselves because then they can take the next step and work to improve themselves. In terms of beauty I believe that most of it is controllable through dress hairstyle and most importantly maintaining health. They are all controllable things and we all have the power to take control of that. This is what I believe people should put more emphasis on if someone questions their appearance. Tell them that if they dont like how they look then they have the power to change it and that you believe that they can. ',\n 'I think it is clear that the online threats directed at feminist public figures benefit their causes. These threats have enabled mainstream media coverage to create a straw man of any opposition to them and has poisoned the well for anyone who finds their views problematic that wants to have a public dialogue about them. As evidence for each of these women I simply did a google search of their name and opened every recent article from a mainstream news source about them on the first pages. Here is what I came up with. Anita Sarkeesian       Zoe Quinn       Every article mentions the threats and only two provide anything close to objective coverage of the controversy. The narrative for almost all mainstream coverage of these women universally supports them and an inordinate portion of these articles focuses on harassment from a small group of psychopaths and trolls which usually includes quotes of some of the most tasteless comments for shock value. Because of this I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters. ',\n 'So basically my view is in the title. I feel like the song Baby its old Outside is about a guy raping a girl. ost people say its about a little harmless romantic seduction but if you notice the lyrics at one point the man gets the woman a drink and she later says say whats in this drink? The end of the song never really says for sure whether she stayed or not but the fact that the song ends with them both singing Ah but its cold outside to me implies that she did stay. I really want to change my view of this because it really bothers me every time I hear the song.

',\n 'I dont want to believe this Ive tried to find a good counterargument but this is how I feel. I dont think theres anything wrong with asexuality or bisexuality or any form of sexuality that doesnt hurt someone. I am biromantic and I can sort of understand being heteroromantic or homoromantic. But I have not heard a description of aromantic that does not make me feel like those people need help. From my perspective romantic attraction is just a natural extension of normal love like the love you have for your friends or family. To fall in love means to trust and care about someone else even more than you do about your friends enough to want to spend your life with them and dedicate a significant amount of your time and resources to their happiness and your mutual happiness. I think love is very important to being mentally and emotionally healthy. I dont think you can be emotionally healthy if you dont have any friends if you shun people and never express love. So when people say that they are physically incapable of loving and trusting someone enough to enter a romantic relationship I feel like something has to have gone wrong. Sexuality is one thing. Sexuality is about physical response and physical acts it is who turns you on and who you want to have sex with. Bodies are weird things physical reactions can range into bizarre in most situations I mean consider allergies and the actions people take are their own business again so long as nobodys getting hurt. But romantic feelings are based in emotion and thought and when something is very different with emotion and thought when you are lacking something that most people have that has to do with emotion and thought we call it a mental disorder. People who are lacking the ability to properly control their motivation and attention have ADHD. People who are lacking the ability to feel alright most of the time have Depression or Bipolar disorder. People who are lacking the ability to distinguish reality are schizophrenic or have delusions. So why are people who are lacking the ability to form romantic relationships...considered fine? Why is there a disconnect between the view of someone who cant make friends such as those with Schizoid Personality Disorder which we do consider problematic and people who can make friends but can never take it any further than that people with Aromanticism which we dont consider problematic? I guess the crux of my argument is that I believe there are different kinds of love of varying strengths. Love for your mom for your grandma for your aunt for your best friend for inanimate things. And I think romantic love is kind of the epitome of it something to strive for. Its one thing to not be in love or not be looking for love but to say youre actually just totally incapable of it? I call that mental illness. hange my view? ',\n 'I really want my view changed here. Badly. y wife wants to have children soon and Ive been gungho about the idea since we started dating.

',\n 'tldr or the way I shouldve phrased the thread initially Abortion is a form of selfdefense. Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in selfdefense should also support abortion in at least some cases if not all. The main justification for being progun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other selfdefense tools is that guns are used to kill not incapacitate. By being progun you are progiving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine stand your ground laws etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Progun activists cant really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you as by the time you know they mean to kill you as opposed to rob you assault you etc. its likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately the progun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone elses life without the need for lengthy deliberation that stateadministered capital punishment requires. Next the main justification for being prolife is that fetuses have personhood and deserve the same rights as people. If youre progun however youre arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mothers health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first as in the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion. However it can be more broadly applied to other less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least abortion must be legalized in cases of rape as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your bodyproperty. This doesnt mean progun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. A counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is progun an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal and fetuses are innocent. However this argument doesnt really fly. Firstly theres no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime it is still by its very existence invading another persons bodyproperty if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a personfetus into your homebody you dont have the right to kill them but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases. Finally theres no corollary here because prochoice arguments dont rely on personhood theres no hypocrisy in being progun rights or progun control because its a completely separate issue.

The thing is I absolutely know it is not going to fail and the only thing that will lead us apart is going to be someones death. I dont think my love is the most special in the whole world and I certainly dont think I am the only person who has ever felt like this but I know many people in marriages of years duration who have less trust compatibility love and happiness in their relationship than we do. The main criticisms I see are You cant possibly be compatible in maturity and life interests which is untrue because I doubt we would be able to have a year long relationship if this was true and he is going to grow old and youll be miserable I dont know if this will happen but I know that love is strong enough that people who love each other will be there for each other in youth amp old age.

',\n 'I dont think that theres such a thing as laziness on its own I think the word can be used to describe behaviors but those behaviors always have more complex underlying mechanics examples below and its always more useful to approach the behaviors from the perspectives of those mechanics than from the perspective of laziness unless your only goal is to be hostile to the person whose behavior youre describing. Laziness can be Depression sometimes people are just psychologicallyemotionally incapable of motivating themselves to do a thing that they want to do. Fear of failure. Bad faith sometimes people dont want to do a thing because it conflicts with their goals but arent being honest with what their goals are. Indecision like bad faith sometimes people have multiple conflicting goals and avoid taking action that would definitively establish a choice. Hostility sometimes people dont do things that would benefit them because they would also benefit someone else from whom they want to withhold that benefit. There are more those were just some examples. The word laziness could defensibly be used to describe any of those rationales. y point is that unless your only goal is to hurt the feelings of the subject or disparage and discredit them choosing to use the word laziness to describe the subject or their choices is counterproductive. ',\n 'So I recently came across this article addressing the consumption of domesticated pets in Switzerland. Im sure this topic has come up in this subreddit before but I still havent been convinced to change my view. I concede that one should not eat pets that have already been claimed i.e. dont take your neighbors cat and put it in your soup. However why shouldnt one be able to go to the local dog pound to pick up some meat for dinner? Animals in shelterspounds are not claimed by anyone and will eventually be euthanized. So why not let someone benefit from these animals? Additionally I find the distinction between catsdogs and other animals to be confusing. Why is it so appalling to consume catsdogs when we have no problems with eating pigs and sheep? Ive encountered the argument that catsdogs have evolved with the human race but to be honest all animals that are currently alive are equally evolved. Of course historically catdogs have had their uses beyond just being food but this idea doesnt seem to apply to horses which were used as transportation sheep which provide wool pigs provide leather and cows provide leather.

He laid out various utensils some pleasant and some unpleasant on a table in front of him and put a bag over his head in a room of complete privacy. He could have stopped it at any moment and chose not to. He also gave some form of explicit permission for the person to do as they pleased. The fact that he is using the same word to describe this as forced sex using violence or drugs is to me appalling. Rather open to hearing other sides of this though so please change my view.

ORIGINAL POST It seems to me that history courses are taught by history professors primarily so that history students can go on and become history professors themselves further saturating the job market for educators that serve no purpose other than to selfdepreciate. For the vast majority of students History courses will have no applicable worth to them postgraduation. Almost no employer is going to care that you can list the reasons that the Roman Empire fell.

However I am an uppermiddleclass white person and while I have undoubtedly been privileged and acknowledge structural racism that is legacy racism that is embedded within the economic system rather than personal hatred I believe that I have no personal duty to the American people or to the AfricanAmerican community as a result of the Ferguson situation. In other words I do not like it when politicians and entertainers call on me to boycott or protest something that does not affect me personally. The essence of structural racism is that it is embedded in the economic system and working people like me have no guilt or personal responsibility beyond acknowledging its existence. !

However it is better to stick with one term or another especially when little reference is made at all to Ancient times. It stands to reason that when it comes to referencing centuries versus specific years that the numerical system rather than the ordinal system is obviously superior we can both designate the s and but we cannot designate an individual year with th century. This system also makes it more difficult for nonEnglish speakers to understand as they have enough on their plate figuring out our mishmash of a language let alone how many dates they could get wrong during translation. Hell I sometimes get it wrong when Im not paying enough attention especially when it gets back into less recent history English speakers know automatically that th century and th century refer to s and s but how many of us automatically make the shift when we hear th century? The only issue I can see is that when discussing Romanera history around the time B AD it might make referring to the st entury AD a little more difficult. However the problem persists even in B with the confusion of the ordinal century lagging behind the actual year date. y is that this is a confusing system and bad for international students casual readers and even for historians and archaeologists. The below proposal is just a suggestion for discussion and shredding it as Im sure this subreddit will will not necessarily change my view on the whole subject. Therefore I think that when referencing these two centuries it might be more instructive to refer to them in a similar manner that some refer to the most recent full decade the oughts. Given that is technically part of the s this means that are referred to on occasion as the oughts when referring to decades in lieu of the s s and so forth. So we should refer to the st century AD as the ought century AD and then continue with s AD s AD and same for B. That was just a suggestion. On the greater subject however Reddit ! ',\n 'I realized this was a controversial view yesterday while driving with my family to Thanksgiving dinner. y sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing and I casually mentioned how I dont believe Id leave any. This was met with much more vitriol from both my mom and sister than I expected. Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes she just kept saying you take care of your own over and over and my mother just kept telling me that is wrong without explaining why Id like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. onsider the following scenario I have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about . I had my kids in my s and so they are now in their s. y assumption would be that during the first or so years I have taken care of their educational costs provided for their basic needs and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their s when they have begun providing for themselves I will be there as a backup should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen but they would be largely left to their own devices. After or so years of that when I die I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I dont even think Id leave anything for the grandkids education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan. The reasoning Statistics of the secondgeneration blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to when you move into the thirdgeneration. To me this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending Im not saying this happens in all cases as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs but Im saying it is the most common reason. Ethics I dont believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldnt be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood why should they be guaranteed these lottery winnings well into adult life when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? oreover leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition. Nearly every tycoon from arnegie to Buffett to Gates has noted that leaving anything more than a small sum of money to their children would be terrible for their ambition and their motivation to make something of their lives. Some final comments I understand that this is putting the cart WAY before the horse. I dont have considerable wealth. I dont even have kids. This is just how I believe Id behave in this scenario given my current mindset. Furthermore I really dont want to come off as miserly but if I do please tell me. Anyway beyond that please try and change my view! ',\n 'larification of statement I am using the definition of absolute pacifism as total nonviolence and unconditional rejection of all forms of warfare. y opinion relies on the following ideas. That sometimes a small act of violence can prevent more violence and thus decrease total violence. Thus a small act of violence can be more moral than a nonviolent act. That an absolute pacifist relies on others to commit violence for their own continued safety for example the subduing of a dangerous criminal by police forces may be violent and that any personal code which requires other persons to break said code in order to be followed cannot be moral. Furthermore resulting from an acceptance of the previous two statements that the act of going to war can be more morally justifiable than the act of refusing to go to war. ',\n 'Im quite pro gun and argue about guns regularly on reddit. I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However when it comes to debate I struggle finding a reason people need an AR. Argument The standard but weak argument I currently give in favor of an AR is everybody is different and needs to find the gun thats right for them different sized hands arm length number of arms less than two and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR thats the gun they should own. Thats my standard argument but theres a part of me that still nags the question if anyone can train to use any weapon why is the AR needed? AR y exposure to the AR community extends beyond just what I hear about on T. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Heres what I think of them personally. What I think of the AR is its a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someones AR theyll ask me if I want to try it then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is they buy their AR then dump money into parts which they add throughout the year. Its like Legos except each brick runs about to and theyre pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. Home defense Now home defense might be the number one reason people get an AR but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in gauge. And you can get a semiauto shotgun with a high capacity magazines tactical rails and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR. gauge is so versatile you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live with more flexibility than what the . or xmm has. Where an AR will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors in a firefight you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself be effective and not kill anyone through drywall with guage which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder then gauge bird shot is the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbors safety. Yes bird shot despite what experts say. I know what Im talking about because Ive screwed around a lot with gauge bird shot and at feet you can cut through a x block of wood with the cheap stuff. If youre not worried about neighbors you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense but its more expensive than the best choice for home defense. AUprising Is the AR a necessary part of the nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before wed get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did wed depend on our military going AWOL first then wed have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I cant even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point but I dont think we have to worry about that any time soon. However if people want to prep for that in case they need their AR later I dont see a problem but that doesnt help me argue why people need one now. AInvasion Does it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure but dont all of our guns do that? We have million of them. If hina was able to invade lol... lets pretend ok? theyd have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs in addition to guns.

I dont believe this is possible without dire consequences that outweigh whatever benefits may exist. There have been quite a few s arguing AGAINST this particular view of mine including one that was mistitled to make it look like he agreed with me. To clarify Im not endorsing the status quo in terms of drug policy. I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance I personally dont use marijuana but I believe its ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco much more harmful and addictive drugs are legal. This applies to crack heroin powder cocaine crystal methamphetamine etc. Im opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think its a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery. The main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. Ive heard a lot of vague arguments that we should tax and regulate these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want but youll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case. urrently there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get. This is DESPITE the fact that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful and addictive than marijuana. Sure youll be able to get your hands on it if you really want to but the law does deter millions. Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the ? I understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. As for the libertarian argument that its a state infringement upon rights I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that and the most simplyworded right isnt always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the War on Drugs but I dont see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.

Over the past hours I have seen so many bullshit posts on facebook about this. Being from the south all of my old friends are posting articles from conservative weekly about how the verdict was right. On the other hand a lot of my more liberal friends who I find myself surrounded with now are just ranting about racism and how fucked up the verdict was. I totally agree. The verdict was fucked up. I feel as if he could have been found guilty of manslaughter. shots? YES. That is excessive. Four were to the handsarm and two to the head. That along with the witness testimonies for the most part saying he had surrendered and still was shot constitutes man slaughter. Due to the conflicting testimonies though he couldnt be charged with murder. Not to mention this all started with Brown robbing a store. The video of Brown stealing the cigarillos shows him aggressively shoving the convenience store clerk as he attempted to confront him. This doesnt seem like the temperament of a guy who would just surrender when confronted by a police officer not to imply that he didnt. Now to the point! I have no idea what happened on that day and how it all unfolded. I have no idea what the motivations of the police officer were. I have no idea if Brown actually grabbed at the gun of the officer. No one does. But all I am hearing about is how certain everyone is that is was somehow racially motivated. I understand it is totally possible that it was racially motivated or influenced in some way. But it is also equally possible that it was simply a matter of circumstance in which someone who had just robbed a store got too aggressive with a police officer and hasty decisions had to be made. I just feel that it is way too easy to mark up such a complex confrontation to a racially motivated slaughtering as a lot of people are acting like especially when nothing would have likely happened had Brown not initiated confrontation with police by robbing a store. I think it is much more likely that the officer simply had to make a hasty decision and went a bit over the top. aybe I have misunderstandings about the facts and if that is the case PLEASE let me know. All in all I just think that it is a cop out to pull the race card on an incident in which literally no one except the people who were there know exactly what happened. oreover NO ONE but the police officer himself knows what his motivations were.

For the majority of that time people when confronted with people who are different have this thought chain enemy tribe threat kill Humans are civilized now which is wonderful but if placed under extreme duress our dumb human brains will resort to the same caveman thought pattern enemy tribe threat kill The recent Ferguson issue has raised questions about how officers treat threatening individuals of different races. Officer Wilson may have used prejudice when under duress and reacting to ichael Brown but it probably was unconscious instead of conscious. Had Brown been white the officer might have treated him as one of his tribe but he didnt. There will always be deepseated mutual distrust between people who are of different races. Its not a white and black problem. It is a human problem with white and black consequences. America is the greatest experiment in multiculturalism in the history of humanity.

',\n 'Given that the mainstream media in the US is now entertainment news instead of actual news I think that when they stop reporting facts on investigations it is bad for the entire country. Just look at Ferguson. Because the media twisted peoples opinions by omitting certain facts and spinning others in a hugely negative light it is now almost impossible to even know what the hell happened. The prosecutor himself admitted during the case that a lot of witnesses changed their stories multiple times usually after being contacted by the media. The media also helped to incite these riots the first time. They insinuated long before it was even possible to have all of the facts that it was nothing more than police brutality and racial profiling. I dont know if it was or wasnt and I am not here to argue that. But because the media insisted that it was before they could confirm that with facts citizens across the country especially in Ferguson believed it. That helped spark the protests which in turn opened the door to looters taking advantage of the situation and destroying peoples lives in the process. I think that if the media were allowed to only present facts that had been verified and not make any unsubstantiated claims from those it would go a long way towards making sure this doesnt happen in the future. We still need to know what is going on which is why the media should be allowed to report. But at the same time we need to know what is going on not what the media wants us to believe went on.

However my sympathy is harshly reduced when someone takes an already limited budget and sets aside money for food drugs or tobacco products. Note the occasional expenditure on a vice is not a problem. A drink at the bar every once and a while or a joint to take the edge off is great we all have to let loose every once and a while arguably even more so with poor people because their lives are by and large very difficult. y issue is that I see many people who struggle to pay the rent pay for food and other basic needs some of whom have kids which makes it much worse who set aside money for outrageously priced pack of cigarettes each week. In essence my problem lies with the people who view these luxuries as just as important as bills rent and food. I did not properly address addiction. I realize these habits can be hard to kick and I do not expect someone to go cold turkey and stop overnight. However I think these people should be actively trying to kick these addictions if it is eating into their primary survival expenditures.

Say someone is being sued by someone else who has a lot of money and they hire a lawyer who has won of his cases and with the first person who cant afford such a high caliber lawyer wouldnt the odds be slightly in favor of the more seasoned lawyer with a proven track record? I would like to not believe this so please help me change my view. ',\n 'I was born in America but due to my mother being Australian pronounce certain words differently. I noticed that for the majority of words that have alternate pronunciations I mostly tended toward the British way i.e I pronounce the letter Z by itself as Zed I find however that whenever I use these words most people go out of their way to correct me. I usually try without too much insistence to explain that there are different pronunciations for the same word and I say it differently due to my heritage. If they push the issue Im happy to concede and change my pronunciation during the rest of the conversation but I still find their insistence mildly offensive. Im aware Im in a particular country that speaks English a certain way but to completely discount alternate and in many cases the original pronunciation as wrong seems nationalistic at best and conceited at worst. Everyone should be mindful of the culture they are in and I can see how I might come across as aloof but I dont do this to be different I do this because I am different just as anyone from any other nationality is different. Its not an attempt to subvert American pronunciation as wrong because it is just as right as any other nations pronunciation. If I could just chalk this up to nationalism I would accept it and move on as just a facet of American culture. However it feels like its just aimed at me. If a anadian was to pronounce about as aboot the worst that will happen is a few jokes. That is ok but my situation is apparently not ok. Please change my view. Because so many people have asked here is more information that I should have included in my original post Yes I have an accent. However I have found that it is a strange mix of Australian and American pronunciation most Americans say I sound either British or Australian and if they think I sound American I sound like Im from the northeast where Ive never lived . Because of this I always explain my accent in the context of where I grew up issouri and my mother teaching me to speak I grew up using Australian slang though I often did not learn it was Australian only until much later in life. I have since for the most part stopped using the slang because it requires explaining whole new words. y pronunciation on the other hand is inherently a part of my accent and because I have to explain that just about every time I meet someone in my mind justifies my pronunciation. I do not think that the British pronunciation is any more right than the American it was a mistake in my part to say it was original. I did not intend sound uninformed or conceited y peers often go out of their way to correct me in a very specific and individual way. They say that because Im American and was raised in America I should sound American. However I find they are ignoring not only my obvious accent but also the profound effect my mother has has on not only my speech patterns but also the words I use. I often try to identify as both Australian and American because to me that is what I am. When my pronunciation gets confusing I will happily switch for the conversation. However when others cannot seem to understand why I sound like that and instead attribute it to me attempting to sound different is when I take offense. In a formal environment I will adhere to the standard which is usually American in nature because that has a very precise meaning of correct',\n 'To my understanding Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary mutual agreements. I am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself in fact I think it is fine. Instead I want to argue that the free markets advocated by most libertarians and most notably libertarian EOs would create a situation that they themselves would think of as unfair. Heres the main argument against free markets while companies are no longer constrained by often inefficient government rules it allows for socalled slave wages and private corporate tyranny meaning that EOs will have their employees working for the bare absolute minimum. Nonsense most Libertarians will say. A voluntary agreement cant be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer. Which is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. orporations know this and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job anywhere where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel? But thats not my problem with libertarianism. seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages etc. y main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory. And heres why the government is fundamentally no different from a corporation providing services. Only here the services are police forces roads health care and all in all society itself. There is only one real difference and that is that in a democratic government citizens can elect their EOs If you as a EO dont like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you wont do that because you lack the resources or because you need the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why its not a choice at all! Well welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only its not a choice at all. If you truly consider this sort of voluntary interaction fair then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is unfair then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself unfair. Therein I think lies the contradiction of Libertarianism. .

Whenever I think about the state of civilization today versus back then I cant help but feel that our society is intellectually inferior to theirs. Where are the Rousseaus? Where are the oltaires? The Lockes? The Kants? The Beethovens? Since then we have produced no major philosophies of our own with the exception perhaps of arxism. Weve seen technological advancements sure but our intellect has not grown to match those advancements. Even in my own short lifetime Ive witnessed a societal shift away from reason and logic. Just look at any textbook out of Texas. If the weight a society places on reason and verifiable fact is a measure of civilization then ours is in decline and has been since the Romantic Era which followed the Enlightenment. . I should note that a big exception to this argument is the institution of slavery which many Enlightenment thinkers appear to have put up with as a necessary evil or even to have endorsed.

For example get days free when you sign up to a month contract extra free on a box of detergent free voucher when you spend or more etc etc. If something is truly free it comes at no cost to the consumer.

The same goes for sexism and other forms of discrimination that generally arent acceptable in modern society but that we tend to give the Baby Boomers and prior generations a pass on. The fact that the man in the article is a public figure is the only reason his racism is coming under fire because if any other old manwoman said the same shit even the least racist people I know would shrug and say something about not even being worth the confrontation due to them being so old and set in their ways.

Now note specifically I am talking about the nonviolent kind of rape where neither member is injured physically but express verbal consent still wasnt given or statutory rape where one member is too young to give consent. It seems to me that in todays society men are expected to want sex all the time. Its most obvious in cases where female teachers have sex with younger boys and peoples reaction to it mostly is NOIE or I wish this happened to me my teacher was hot. Then when it happens with the sexes reversed the reaction is mostly That disgusting pedo deserves to get anally raped in jail and Oh that poor girl a terrible thing has been done to her. As a result of this you come across a lot of men who have been technically raped but who simply get over it extremely quickly despite feeling dirty violated etc as other guys around them just say stuff like You got laid dude quit complaining. Essentially society acts to minimise those bad feelings allowing the man to move on quickly. However when a woman gets raped societys reaction amplifies these bad feelings to make the woman feel even worse. Society makes women feel they are now damaged and a mark has been burned on them forever. This kind of thing is obvious in cases where a woman who initially thought a sexual encounter was just uncomfortable is now told she was raped. Societys general reaction to rape would only make the woman feel even worse about it and not let her move on for a much longer time than for a man. I am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong but it seems to be that way. So does society make female rape victims feel worse about it then they would otherwise?

I would not care if anyone calls me by another ethnicity. Im not proud of my race as no one should be. But Arabs well they arent famed for positive things not only in the Westerner globe but across the entire world. I could write and write about how being called an Arab is insulting but just keep in mind that for the past twenty years or so Arabs havent actually been a model ethnicity. Some people even go far as saying Iranians dont consider themselves Arab. What the hell does that mean? Iranians arent Arab. Theyre Persian Kurd Gilaki Lor etc. How can they not consider themselves Arab. Thats why I believe this should be a hate crime. We Iranians are proud people and we never liked Arabs.

',\n 'While I know this is a popular topic I feel that I have specific points in my argument that have not been addressed before. Full disclosure I am an Asian living in a high income white town Glastonbury T In addition as a high performing student I am directly affected by Affirmative Action. In my defense I would point out that a blackhispanic on the other side would be just as affected. With this argument everyone has a bias and an agenda. First the facts SAT Scores Note while this is in the criticism sections please only look at the data and not the editorial comments as to get a nonbiased outlook Black graduation Note as this is called the Black Journal of Higher Education I trust that no one will call me out on using a source that favors my case . Lets address my last claim first It doesnt improve the black condition and is unnecessary for the vast majority of blackshispanics This idea is supposed to level the playing field with all races. All this actually does is passes deserving and intelligent Whites and Asians over for less intelligent and undeserving people in an environment they cant succeed in. For example black graduation rates are much lower than white graduation rates.  The difference reaches up to points which is clearly not equality. This disparity is due to affirmative action putting incompetent and undeserving Blacks and Hispanics in college. However I must make an important clarification. I believe that the vast majority of blacks can succeed in college and have done so. Affirmative action is not necessary for these kinds of people. The only people affirmative action helps are those who wouldnt be able to get into college otherwise and by getting them into college they will only have false expectations and ultimately perform poorly when they realize that college grading is color blind. This is the idea of mismatching and has been backed up by research. . Affirmative action unfairly favors blackshispanics over Asians and thus is racist towards Asians. Ok you make the argument that this favoritism towards blackshispanics is simply reparations for past transgressions Jim row and the low. Well Asians have been heavily discriminated against in the past. Jap interment railroad building and racial slurs and stereotypes have all been a part of AsianAmerican history. In fact Id argue that hispanics have been least discriminated in US history. wiki page From this if you believe that AA is payback for past actions defend the favoring of blacks over Asian Americans. . Affirmative action is a result of blackshispanics that just want to favor their own race. Note I must admit for this I have no direct proof only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others. BlacksHispanics have more political power in this country than Asians in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore I believe AA is simply a way to get the black voteblacks helping out each other. Obviously being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. larence Thomas as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black this is a big factor a white Justice would get labeled racist is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist not only towards other races but blacks themselves.

While I do admit I believe very strongly in my position I would point out that I have remained civil in my point provided sources and made full disclosure in my situation and any opinions not directly proven by facts. ost importantly I recognize that I am heavily influenced by this topic and thus may be blinded.

Ethical consumerism is a type of consumer activism that is based on the concept of dollar voting. It is practiced through positive buying in that ethical products are favored or moral boycott that is negative purchasing and companybased purchasing. In practice we can view something like Green sourcing as an example of this behavior. You go to buy a given good and find two choices one of which is slightly more expensive than the other but promises that it was produced using Sustainable forestry or the like. Now there are several problems with this. First of all given that the Green option is more expensive at no actual added utility to the enduser such consumerism is limited more to higherincome people who often buy not just for utility but for cosmetic luxury and an appearance of being environmentallyfriendly. In practice this means that ethical consumerism is at best a mostlyirrelevant niche market a lonely island in a sea of unethical behavior. Secondly it puts the impetus on the consumer not on the corporation to determine the responsible use of resources. A common argument used by libertarians is that issues like climate change and the globalized exploitation of sweatshop labor are selflimiting problems as people will generally prefer the more humanitarian purchase. In practice ethical consumerism is used as an excuse to abolish democraticallyimplemented regulations leaving huge questions the environment workers rights and the like to the will of a system that inherently values profit over superficial ethics. Whether or not Florida is sunk by rising sea levels is not a triviality that should be left to making sure you buy the right soy sauce. Similarly whether or not an employee is treated well should not hang on purchasing the right iphone case these are things that should be ensured by the democratic process and capitalism should work around those rules. ',\n 'Since my town installed roundabouts Ive found that they are remarkably more efficient than the traffic lights and four way stops. Four way stops force all vehicles to come to a complete stop traffic lights force many vehicles to come to a complete stop before continuing movement roundabouts allow most vehicles to go through while maintaining inertia. Traffic lights also would appear to be the most expensive of the options considering building costs general upkeep paying engineers and installing vehicle detecting hardware. Traffic lights also seem to have an increased risk of high speed accidents because drivers will not always have to slow down and pay attention. WSDOT did a study on this and they found that roundabouts had less fatalities than traffic lights. Roundabouts also allow traffic to move more quickly than way stops according to mythbusters. tldr Roundabouts are safer more efficient for maintaining inertia faster cheaper.

Im not ugly by any means and Ive had a little success but it was only when I pretended to be someone who Im not and basically acted like the girl didnt exist until the night we hooked up.

',\n 'I do not think there is an inherent purpose to life. I believe that life is in fact an accident and that our existence is coincidental. Being so I also dont believe in eternal truths mainly in the notion that there is an inherent good that people should be trying to attain. If any purpose exists it is constructed within the person for otherwise why would people exist? It is not to serve nature surely for humans ultimately oppose nature especially in modern society. In the case that there was a God I suppose one could argue that we exists for the Gods sake but why? For entertainment? I am really not clear how purpose can be inherent and not constructed. The same goes for the greater good. There does not seem to be a good that exists from with out the person or societies. If there were a greater objective good why then with the exception of murder and incest are very few things seen as universally bad among all societys? And why are few things seen as universally good? For example in America it is seen as wrong to arrange a marriage especially among children under . But in many countries that is the standard. If a universal good exists how come there is so much variance as to what is right and wrong? However I believe this to be a good thing. As opposed to more traditional nihilism which equates meaningless to life being futile I believe that the lack of a notion of a greater good or purpose is a freeing thing. With no greater purpose or greater good one can construct it for oneself. The most important thing becomes ones personal experience in the world and maximizing that to its full potential. There is no worry of not meeting a cosmic standard the standards are within yourself. And so a person does not have to be limited from most any experience unless they so desire it. As such I would categorize myself as an ethical hedonist without any inherent purpose experience is the most important thing and pleasurable experience being the greatest kind of experience one should strive for that for themselves. However because all people are on this journey one persons search for pleasure cannot infringe on another. I fully believe if everyone felt this way society would be more functional as everyone would be operating on the basis of mutual respect. So Reddit hange y iew about any and all of these things . Life having a purpose . The existence of an inherent good . The absence of these being freeing . The idea that if ethical hedonism were the standard society would be more functional.

A simplified version of this theory because of the last item is conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions. y point is the problem is that Haidts methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things for example desecreating knowledge burning books or libraries. I think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example. It is not simply a careharm thing I think perfectly voluntary violence like an A match with some blood will disgust liberals more than conservatives. Similarly ask them about how they feel about shooting a dog who is in incurable pain and debilitating disability and therefore it is a caring not harmful act liberals will feel more disgusted by it. So if you balance your questions properly you take into account different kinds of disgust you dont find liberals are less motivated by disgust than conservatives. Similarly it is not that liberals are less likely to respect authority but more like they respect different authorities the police less and scientists more. In loyalty Haidt focuses too much on loyalty to your nation or family and not your political movement or social class. y view is that with properly balanced questionnaires that take into account that US liberals and conservatives are upset by different things these differences would disappear.

Now Im not arguing here that Waffle House sells mediocre waffles or mediocre food in general thats a given. Im saying that the waffles served at Waffle House dont even qualify as waffles. Lets relive my first Waffle House experience. Ive recently moved to a college town my team just won a football game and I go to the local WH downtown and Im starving. I order two chocolate chip waffles. Imagine my surprise when I get two geometrically patterned pancakes with chocolate chips on top. I was outraged. Now you may be saying hey theyre still waffles just not waffles to your liking. Let us look at the erriamWebster waffle definition. waffle wfl wo noun a crisp cake of batter baked in a waffle iron Waffle House waffles fail to meet the crisp part of their definition. They are very thin and only their checkered pattern distinguishes them from pancakes. Ladies and gentleman a pattern of squares on baked batter does not a waffle make. True waffles are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside and at least double the height of a pancake. Either Waffle House needs to change the name of the waffles they serve or change the recipe because innocent people are deceived daily by this social injustice. Also I would like to eat at Waffle House but I am only disappointed when I think about how my waffle craving will only be teased and never satisfied. so I can be a cheap college students like all of my friends. ',\n 'I have seen a number of s arguing the opposite view i.e. that depression isnt real isnt chemically motivated shouldnt be treated with drugs etc. but I would like to look at things from the other angle. I believe that the number of people suffering from depression is much higher than reported but due to stigmas around depression and seeking help in the forms of counseling and drugs people will often be unaware of their condition or even if they are aware decide that they shouldnt attempt to get relief. From what I understand seeking psychiatric help is voluntary and requires will on the side of the patient to decide whether he or she wantsneeds to seek help. However other medical illnesses arent treated this way if you go to the doctor for a routine checkup and your cholesterol is high the doctor will attempt to intervene and the patient is expected to take the doctors advice. The crux of my view is that I believe the same should be done for mood disorders. Please .

I completely get that they can be extremely frustrating the quality can be less than theyre worth and when all is said and done may not actually save a business as much as they think. However I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so theres a lot of data entry and it got me thinking that theres nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job. The call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced. I dont think there should be a stigma. They provide a service at a lower cost. Why do I deserve a job more than Rahul Priya or ahesh? If a company benefits from it why not? But is there something Im not seeing? ! Im totally up for a change lets do it! companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs. conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable. outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door. companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words theyre potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that dont know what theyre doing and now they dont work properly. Again its not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. ore from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I dont think there should be a stigma.

',\n 'First of all I want to say that there is room in this discussion for personal preference. Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise. There is music that I dont enjoy listening to but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate. Likewise everyone has those guilty pleasure artistssongs where we know theyre bad but love them anyway. In either case there is something about the music that we find good whether an infectious melody or wellconstructed lyrics or a wailing solo. Which returns me to trap. I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing. I cant relegate it to Im not into it but can see why others do because I cant see why others like it which is why I turn to you Reddit. y objections are as follows inimalism works against it. inimalism in music is not always bad. I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect. It creates a great tensionandrelease element to a song and when used well is orgasmic. This tension is a staple in the Trap sound replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody generally speaking. On an subjective level this is musical blue balls but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level. The reason the ED staple of builddrop works is because of the tensionrelease cycle. Its like those amusement park rides that take you up feet and then well drop you. The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup. Trap on the other hand employs an almost identical build and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience. Imagine if instead of dropping the full feet the ride drops you feet. You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation. Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core never rleasing the tension fully. As a result instead of effectively building a proper tensionrelease cycle Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled. Possible rebuttal to The amusement park model doesnt work for Trap. In that case what is a better model with which to consider Trap? Absence of complexity. Im not looking for ozart the DJ. Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow. note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent. I would like skill in my music. Trap as a genre feeds the instrumentalfetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they dont play a real instrument. ED can do so much more and Ive heard it do so much more. Just never in this genre. Possible rebuttal to aYoure just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike. Possibly but I dont think so. Even if the bar were set really low like One Direction low maybe the best choruses of Trap that are distinctly Trap not simply elements of other ED genres which automatically set the majority of trap above D could surpass them in terms of quality. aybe. bOther genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity. Agreed however no genre aside from Ambient Drone makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself. c Simplicity is not always bad. Agreed. Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects. y argument is that Trap does not. Its likely that I wont enjoy Trap music after this thread but I do want to understand those that do like it and if they like it whether they actually think it constitutes quality music. Thank you. Example  This is a fairly standard in my mind example of Trap elements. steady drone with highhats composing the background for a melody of lets face it one note with some ornaments. Example  Remix also including elements mentioned above. Better than most but only just. Example  hanging up the formula a little with this one. The downtempo nature brings something different to the table and its minimalism actually contributes to its overall feel. Definitely not the norm though. Example  songs that could serve as an adequate standard for what I mean by Trap. Note that my argument is not that all sound the same but that the similar features are the defining features of Trap and that those features in themselves constitute poor music.',\n 'A link to the story for those unaware Now I want to preface this by saying two things one I identify as a feminist as even a quick glance through my post history will attest and two Im not necessarily saying I think the damn thing was a good idea but I certainly dont think it was worth the todo thats going on. For those that dont wish to check out the link one of the Rosetta scientists wore a shirt with some sexy pseudopinup style women on it. Its kind of a dorky shirt but hey I dont judge. Its probably not appropriate for your T interviews as a representative of the scientists that just put a rover on a comet but again your choices are yours. But the backlash against this poor guy was such that he apologized crying for ever daring to wear the thing. He was lambasted and belittled all for daring to have zero fashion sense. This seems utterly ridiculous to me and also I feel presents something of a double standard. I think if a woman had shown up in the public eye in that outfit she would at worst have been called tasteless. In some circles she likely even would have been lauded. In my eyes thats hypocrisy at its height and I do not approve. Our movement is supposed to be about equality not about bullying. I would love for you to explain why Im wrong.

I am not implying that the karma system should be removed or changed in any way I am simply saying that the karma system is the reason behind this. I firmly believe that having any sort of controversial opinion on Reddit is absolutely pointless and that the karma system is the main reason that is. The karma system allows one group to impose their beliefs on another with a whose side has more people who believe in this kind of numbers game. It always comes down to the fact that if the hivemind does not completely agree with your opinion your post will simply be buried deep within the bellows of the website and very little discussion will ever be had about it. Every Redditor knows that saying things that are generally unpopular with the majority of Reddit can mean an infinite amount of karma loss and possible continuous harassment. For example I remember a while back I do not have a link sorry. of a Redditor who posted something negative about Jennifer Lawrence. He made a meme soon after explaining something about it and then I eventually seen a Bad Luck Brian meme about him several days later because every comment he ever made or close to was downvoted into oblivion and he was harassed nonstop. His having a different opinion than the hivemind pretty much destroyed his account. Something very similar happened to me once before as well when I was new to the website. I posted what is generally a very unpopular opinion on Reddit before I was aware that it was because it is my personal belief. The topic was the legalization of marijuana for recreational uses and I was hoping for some discussion about it because I had asked a question to another Redditor as to why he felt the way he did towards it being legalized something I am personally against. I asked why he was prolegalization stated one reason I am against it and told him that his story had made my day. I did not attack his opinion I did not downvote him I upvoted him in fact because I enjoyed the story he wrote and I had no ill intentions whatsoever. Instead of some sort of civil discussion and my question being answered what I got was overly defensive comments not from him he did not reply calling me an idiot just for having that opinion downvotes that never seemed to end on that comment until I deleted it being attacked for every little thing related or otherwise and no real discussion to be had. I was practically forced to delete that comment because of the nonstop harassment if I wanted to continue using my account. y comment also was not to just incite an argument seeing as how there was others saying how it should just be legalized in the other comments already and this was not a marijuana related subreddit I.E rtrees. It was raskreddit and the topic of legalization had already been present before I had posted that I was against it. Reddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions something nobody should be harassed for. Harassment of those with controversial opinions continues and is something I regularly see being mentioned on subreddits like roffmychest. If so few are willing to truly have a discussion and instantly take to this numbers game then what point is there in even posting your opinion if its not what the collective wants to see? The karma system buries what you said or posted essentially making it absolutely pointless. Intellectual conversation and debate on a topic is difficult when opinion is valued more than the quality of the post itself. So please change my view. ',\n 'Note I originally posted this in rexplainlikeimfive but I realized it would probably be better suited to here. Ive been thinking about the concept of a month. Is there any reason for it to exist? It seems like it would be simpler to have something like Day instead of February . At the moment the year is split up into twelve chunks but theyre not quite equal their lengths appear to have no logical order aside from summing to or and one of them has a different length every years. Whenever we refer to the frequency of an event as say once a month we could just as easily say that its once every days. larification Im saying that as it is once a month is very imprecise anyway since months have varying lengths. For anything that can be this arbitrary once every days works just as well. Leap years would also be extremely simple instead of adding a day to a particular month a day could just be added to a year. The year would then go up to Day instead of Day . Heres an example of why I think a calendar without months would be easier. Suppose its Saturday September th or Day . Lets suppose I wanted to figure out what day of the week December th Day would be. To figure it out in my head using the current months system I would have to go through the following procedure which could probably be reduced a bit but not greatly is a Saturday is a Saturday is a Tuesday is a Tuesday is a Tuesday is a Friday is a Friday is a Friday is a Saturday is a Saturday is a Friday On the other hand if I wanted to figure out the same thing using a numberedday system it would be simple Day Day days days mod . Therefore Day is days later than a Saturday so its a Friday. onsider this answered but if you disagree about the last point feel free to change my view on that too Ill still be reading comments. ',\n 'I dont believe humans are meant to be monogamous. Based on the fact that we used to be cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on I believe that while we have clearly evolved from that biology has still framed us to struggle with monogamy. In many ways I think we have animalistic tendencies when it comes to interpersonal relationships and that people will always struggle with looking for someone better because of natural selection and all that jazz. Also testosterone is a powerful thing. arriage for example is a social construct and legal contract more than anything. And whether married or not failed relationships and cheating is just way too prevalent to be coincidental. I think our bodies struggle with remaining loyal to one person even if we are emotionally complex enough to realize that this is wrong. While from an idealistic stance I think its awesome to think we could find one partner who is the one and successfully remain with them indefinitely I have a hard time believing that is indeed the case. hange my view.

Having been in the American military for six years myself I have a lot of friends on social media who are or were service members. Every year around this time my whole Facebook wall turns in to soandso changed her profile picture accompanied by a photo of them doing something in uniform and then in a few days it will change back to something more current. Im not trying to say that we should be embarrassed or ashamed of our service. Quite the opposite. When you change your picture for eterans Day and emorial day though it seems like youre just begging people to thank you and give you attention. In my opinion it isnt any different from a fit girl posting a picture in yoga pants and a sports bra with the caption Im so ugly I need to lose so much weight lol! Either people know you well enough to say thanks or they dont really care about you or what you did anyway so begging them for attention seems really unbecoming. And if this were just one or two people Id laugh and say they were just douchey but it seems like almost everyone I know that served does this and I find the culture of it really offputting. Thanks for your time and . ',\n 'This is inspired by an article on TIL so I will quote that for starters The comments section on this post was overwhelmingly filled with rage against the state for performing what some term mutilation on this child as well as countless comparisons to David Reimer I am baffled by the response to the article and disagree with the Reimer comparison so I would like my view changed. For starters I think Reimer is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of socalled therapy that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals. But I dont see why that implies sex reassignment surgery on children is inherently evil. Unlike Reimer this child was not born with a single sex and then reassigned to a different one. He also wasnt forced into traumatic pseudoscientific behavioral therapy. From what I read it sounds like he was raised like any normal girl would be. I think the comparisons to Reimer are an example of the Reddit hivemind desperately seeking comparisons for what they perceive to be medical malpractice. Im certainly open to being convinced Reimers case is relevant but its not the important part of my view. As stated in the title I dont see anything wrong with what the doctors in this case did. The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Lets look at some alternative scenarios. First if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. Its functionally the same as if they had been born that way. If the intersex child hadnt received surgery he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male female or whatever along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened and its what I disagree with. I can only speculate on what that life would be like so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough especially dealing with body and gender issues. Im not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex but that doesnt mean I wouldnt have been embarrassed about it if I were years old and my genitals didnt look like anyone elses. And much as I think our societys gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened it doesnt change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier. Worst of all I cant imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult as a guy the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific or being stuck in a body you dont feel comfortable in. Note that in the case in question the child doesnt identify as intersex he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FT surgery is much harder than TF but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth so he had the option to become female later rather than leaving him intersex. Therefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender reassignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice great. If they make the wrong choice Im no different from any other trans person. By the way Im not saying intersex infants should have to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex I guess thats their choice just like theyre free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice and if my parents did that I would be mad at them but again Im not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory. Im just saying its not inherently wrong to perform the surgery.

',\n 'This is a well documented viewpoint but last night I had an argument on this topic with a friend whose intelligence I greatly respect. Try as I might I just cant see how at least the first part of the statement could be false. I present this in the true spirit of I feel like I might be missing something. y particular view is that in a number of Disney movies the heroes skins are aucasian and the villains skins are shades of dark brown purple grey and that this creates an association between evil and dark skin that children pick up very easily. There are plenty of Disney movies where this is not the case but there are enough that it is an issue Aladdin Lion King Little ermaid ulan Hercules probably more. Beyond this obvservation there are a variety of arguments that many Disney movies are racist An article from the Guardian detailing the history mainly from a stereotype voice actors race angle. A listicle with plenty of video links some back to the s amp s. Is there anyone that will argue that even these are not harmfully racist? And if they are harmfully racist at which point did the racism disappear or become benign? Diversity in Disney Films a collection of Essays. Several more books on Amazon. So where are the well reasoned arguments that these depictions are not racist? I think there is some fundamental disagreement between my friend and I on the way meaning is created and thus how media works. For her the darkness evoking evil stops there it is only incidental that skin is being used as the pallet. She goes on to joke about blue people being offended by Genie etc... Further she believes that the model is just too simple. That the mechanisms of racism are much more complicated than this belief allows and that it is this kind of thinking that leads to rampant Political orrectness. This is possibly why I am most interested in this argument. I find many arguments that lead to rampant P to be compelling but I certainly detest the world in which we are all policing each other for racial feminist etc.. correctness. For me it naturally follows that if these characters are teaching negative stereotypes about race then they are harmful to children as they learn about the world. If you agree that the movies are racist but that they dont have that big of an impact on children Id be interested in those arguments as well. Finally Im much more interested in scholarly or at least wellstudied arguments than how you personally feel about the subject without deep consideration. I will gladly devour any links you have to support your arguments.

However in spite of all this doomsaying the quality of life of the average Japanese has seen almost no impact from the downturn and remains better than that of the large Western democracies such as the US or the UK. Japanese have longer lives than any large European country some of the lowest rates of violent crime on earth a highly trusting society skyhigh test scores a healthy level of inequality and a generally content populace.

',\n 'Hello everyone Ill prefice by saying English isnt my main language so I apologize for any misunderstanding feel free to ask what did I mean by saying X. I discovered TRP a few months ago. I believe it was on of the biggest shocks to my personal views on the world. All my life I suffered from lack of sexualsocial success I wasnt confident I didnt know how to deal with people around me and I basically reverted to being a nice guy which is something people amp popculture advocates through advice movies selective presentation by the media and so forth. When I was introduced to the PUA community years ago and eventually TRP a few months ago it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in todays society in terms of being socialsexual. Those communities taught me about confidence staying true to myselfself embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars in a way that is actually applicable to the real world and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement. I do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women to a point of dehumanizing them. But on the other hand there is no other community that gives you genuine advice on how to become that successful person you always wanted to be and reach your goals in life and I sincerely believe that someone who will ignore the RAoriented side of TRP and focus on the advice they give on selfimprovement as proven mostly true by peoples Field Reports will prosper beyond his imagination and theres no competition in that field. The world is a harsh place full of mostly egocentric people that will not reach out for people with that kind of weaknesses and one must seek it out in places like TRP to have a chance of actually bettering theirselves. The reason I believe that is by looking at facts Before being exposed to the PUA community and TRP I had no courage to even talk to a girl I had interest in was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years. This applies to a lot of men my age who you could see for a fact that didnt even know how to deal with those kind of issues and suddenly its like they swallowed a magic pill. After Learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction as directly suggested by those communities take responsibility for sexual escalation which doing only halfassed while not being experienced always turned girls off and finally lost my virginity. Also I am generally much more confident got rid of most of my depressive nature and people actually like to be around me way more than before. hange my view. ',\n 'A few weeks ago a woman who was formerly a Baltimore Ravens cheerleader was arrested for rape after allegedly having sexual relations with a yearold boy. This story is not all that unique as there are plenty of instances when older women often teachers have been arrested for having sex with males under the age of consent. And while I dont necessarily think that women in these cases should not be punished at all I think punishing them as much as older men who prey on young girls is also not appropriate. I dont think its a controversial statement to say that males are naturally more sexually aggressive and promiscuous than females. That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put men want sex more than women they just do. Sure or year old boys may not have the mental andor emotional capability to fully consent to sex but pretending that boys at that age dont want sex is completely disingenuous and so is pretending that girls by and large are as driven by sexual motives as boys. Furthermore adolescent boys are often physically bigger and stronger than older women so feelings of coercion in that respect are not as pronounced if the genders were switched. So please explain to me why there shouldnt be a double standard in this scenario. ',\n 'Now with states starting to legalize marijuana a lot of people are saying that people who got jailed for smugglingusing marijuana should be release. I however disagree. Assuming that the law was a reasonable law that got removed because our society changed to such an extent that we no longer need the law the people who broke such a law should be jailed solely for the fact that they ignored the law. Examples of similar scenarios would be someone getting fined for driving on a road whos speed limit was but later the limit rose to . Or someone getting fined for jwalking on a place that later added a crosswalk. In those cases I think that most people would agree with me that those people should not get their money returned. In order for my view to be changed I would have to change my belief that solely for being a criminallaw breaker warrens you being punished',\n 'Whenever I read something in perfect columns I always hate coming across a word broken up by a hyphen just for the sake of having the column of words look nice and be all even. Sometimes you can read the word easily because its made of components like because or always which isnt so bad. But sometimes the words are made of phonemes that your brain only comprehends when it sees all the letters together like trough or anachronistic or morphology. It gives me needless pause when reading a text and I just encountered a problem that put the nail in the coffin for me. I was reading a journal article on PDF and I was trying to trlF a word I distinctly remember reading but it wouldnt work. Was I mistaken about the word being in the text? No! I eventually found the sentence I was looking for and to my frustration I realized that I couldnt search it because there was a Fucking Hyphen it he word!!! who cares of the right side of columns look a little choppy from time to time. breaking up words doesnt make sense anymore if it ever did.

But that doesnt mean that every church or belief has to agree to perform marriages between homosexual people. If a specific belief says theyre against gay marriage and dont want to perform it thats fine. The gay people can just go next door to the church of a different faith or to a courthouse.

Acceptance of funds from any single person or group makes that entity an investor in that research. . An investor in research should have access to the end results of that research. . If a researcher accepts government grants to fund their research then that government and by extension its citizens have become an investor and should have free access to the published work.

',\n 'As a former soldier I always feel slightly guilty that I cant get into the spirit of commemorating the first world war and especially the sacrifices made by those who fought in it. In fact I believe those sacrifices were made in vain. The Second World War can be seen as a blackandwhite moral struggle against monstrously oppressive forces. The soldiers who gave their lives in that conflict can legitimately be seen as laying their lives down to oppose fascism and protect some basic institutions of human freedom. I do not believe the same can be said for the First World War. In my view it was an impersonal struggle between empires over territory which had no moral component. I do not believe that the majority of individuals fighting in the trenches had any personal stake in the outcome. It was a hugely pointless waste of life and human suffering which certainly did not improve anyones lives or prospects. Furthermore the brutal punishment meted out to the German people afterwards caused decades of misery and directly opened the door to Nazism. So what are the arguments against that point of view?

Lots probably of assignments I get are almost completely illegible lots of scratched out work and answers to questions are not clearly indicated. Every time I see an assignment like this I would love to put a giant X through the page and say no credit illegible. However the professor I work for wants to give credit to everyone who turns in assignments and doesnt want to be any sort of ultrastrict assholeish prof. You may say jwult the legibilitypenmanship does not dictate a correct answer! If the answer is right they should get credit! y response is this You are in college you should have already learned to write legibly If your penmanship is that bad type your homework. It can be done it may not be fun but it can be done. Homework is about communicating that you know the material and can obtain a correct solution to a problem. If you cant communicate clearly write clearly you should not get credit. A core of engineering is about communicating. No one cares what you have donediscovered if you cannot properly communicate it to others. So again if you cant communicate clearly write clearly you should not get credit.

They portray Nicki as Hitler and have the other rappers as her subordinates. They dont seem to be playing a role that they are satirizing or criticizing as the lyrics are about them. I suppose it is possible that they are criticizing their fan base for following them blindly. But I dont understand why they would do that and it is insulting to how horrible the Nazis were. I feel that I must be missing something here. I am not a huge fan of rap or any of these artists nor am I an outspoken critic.

',\n 'With the recent discussion of Street Harassment thanks to a number of viral videos and the news coverage of them I started to wonder why there was no recourse for those tired of being harassed. Thinking it through for a small time I could think of no good reasons why Street Harassment wasnt somehow criminalized especially with all of the legislation protecting women from harassment in the workplace Or providing them ample recourse if they are harassed. What could the possible issues be of penalizing Street Harassment? Would it be a good idea to enact legislation against atcalling Whether on a local state or federal basis?

The world is progressively getting worse and by the time my child is grown up they must be subjected to some awful things. uch worse to what Ive experienced. Everyday on the news I see endless amounts of saddening worrying or scary news. The amounts of conflicts and struggles in the world are more prevalent then ever before. In my personal experience my parents had it much easier than I did there was less people in anada which means that competition for Universities jobs and things like that were much less competitive. There were less awful occurrences such as school shootings terrorist attacks and so on. Environmental problems were an issue but people lived in ignorant bliss. The world is in a progression of getting worse so why bring another person into it?',\n 'I sincerely doubt that anyone visiting Iran or North Korea is unaware of the strict enforcement that these countries mete out to foreigners attempting to demonstrate against or change an internal policy. They know full well what theyre getting into. Bringing hrists message to North Korea? Jail. Want to change Irans policies concerning women attending sports events? Jail. People who do this are either naive fools or are religious fools. They bring potential harm to their home countries by providing a bargaining chip and advantage to the imprisoning governments. Western governments need to make it clear to travelers to these countries that if they intentionally break laws or provoke the system theyll face dire consequences with no assistance from their home government. Western visitors to Iran and North Korea who knowingly provoke the regime should expect severe punishment and no assistance from their home government. ',\n 'You may have seen recent viral video that aims to fight street harassment Hours of Walking in NY as a Woman  While there are some instances of harassment in that video I think that calling compliments and greetings harassment serves nobody . It is not respectful to real victims of harassment because it trivializes the issue. . It disrupts normal social dynamics between people. . It is not in the interest of women that want to meet somebody that men are being discouraged to approach them. . It will not deter creepy guys from harassing women because apparently they dont have any problem even with real harassment. Radical feminists think that approaching a woman you dont know should automatically be characterized as harassment. That is the most counterproductive and retarded way to deal with the problem of harassment the world has ever seen. P.S. Because I was so astounded by the stupidity of this video I made a parody video featuring Pep Le Pew  If you want to see some real harassment watch a few Pep Le Pew cartoons. P.P.S. A reply I made to a girl commenting on YouTube  I have already retracted this statement see the discussion.

Basically I dont see why there exist separate mens and womens bathrooms. The following are my thoughts Theres no reason a woman couldnt use a bathroom which also had a urinal and theres no reason a man couldnt use a stall in place of a urinal. Were just in there to use the bathroom. If youre using a stall theres no way to tell the gender of another person anyway so whats it matter if theyre standing or sitting? And if a guys using a urinal whats it matter? His back is to you you cant see anything. In places with unequal numbers of men and women like an office separating can lead to one bathroom being overfull while the other has perfectly usable stalls that people dont use because theyre not the right gender. As transqueer gendered people are coming out and becoming more accepted distinguishing between two genders for the bathroom just reinforces a gender binary that could potentially alienate them. There are already unisex and family bathrooms some places that are used with no complaint. That whole separate but equal problem probably fits in here somewhere.

So convince me otherwise.',\n 'This isnt a strongly held view of mine and Im very open to changing it but its something Ive thought for quite a while now. Basically I dont see why there exist separate mens and womens bathrooms. The following are my thoughts Theres no reason a woman couldnt use a bathroom which also had a urinal and theres no reason a man couldnt use a stall in place of a urinal. Were just in there to use the bathroom. If youre using a stall theres no way to tell the gender of another person anyway so whats it matter if theyre standing or sitting? And if a guys using a urinal whats it matter? His back is to you you cant see anything. In places with unequal numbers of men and women like an office separating can lead to one bathroom being overfull while the other has perfectly usable stalls that people dont use because theyre not the right gender. As transqueer gendered people are coming out and becoming more accepted distinguishing between two genders for the bathroom just reinforces a gender binary that could potentially alienate them. There are already unisex and family bathrooms some places that are used with no complaint. That whole separate but equal problem probably fits in here somewhere. I understand and accept that places susceptible to potential harassment should probably segregate the bathrooms bars clubs locker rooms possibly high schools but for restaurants and lots of businesses it seems kind of silly to me.

I work moderately hard always take my job seriously and deliver the required results. But I also take pride in achieving as much as possible with as little effort as possible. I am always searching for opportunities to automate tedious and repetitive parts of my job and I try to completely avoid taking on projects that have a low return compared to their workload. Out of principle I never work more longer than a hour week unless its a real emergency. So far Ive done OK. Im an engineer and most of my jobs are year contracts for large corporations. Im not high up the corporate ladder but the salary is high enough to cover all my material needs plus save about for retirement. I know that if I worked a lot harder I would have the chance to be promoted to a director position but I dont see the point. The net wage would be higher but I would have to sacrifice more than of my timeampenergy for the corporation. Also in my field director positions seem less safe than manager positions. Directors cost more and are the first people to be laid off when there is a restructuring. I cannot take my achievements to the grave. To me life is not about achievements but about experiences. Achievements are just a means to an end which is having awesome experiences. There is a case to be made that social status itself is an experience worth pursuing but corporate titles dont really impress the people closest to me. They only impress people I dont like and dont care about. There certainly are situations where hard work is worth it but working for a corporation is not one of them. ost of the fruits of your labor will go to the shareholders and not to your salary. For an employee the returns diminish very sharply in the corporate word. A higher position can mean more autonomy but it also means managing people which is not something I enjoy. And since I do mostly contract work I already have some autonomy in choosing the projects I will work on. Having said all that I cannot get rid of the feeling that Im somehow letting myself down. Rationally it all makes sense but emotionally there is still my dads voice in my head telling me that I should work hard. Is it worth listening to that voice? ',\n 'There are two parts to this view and I will award deltas if you can change either of them. The first is that money in courts is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. When I see cases where a drunk kid kills people but their rich parents get them off with their crack team of lawyers or a powerful corporation destroys a regular person or small business with a costly court case on extremely weak grounds because the small business cant afford to fight back I am sickened. Equality in the eyes of the law is in my opinion the single most important part of our society and in the current system the rich and the poor are not equal in the eyes of the law. The second part of my view is that a good solution to this problem is to require that both sides in a lawsuit or court case contribute equally to their own legal team and their opponents. Ive thought long and hard about this and this is the best thing I can come up with. Other attempts to bring equality to courts that Ive seen all fall short somewhere. The loser paying the winners legal fees doesnt help because it only takes place after the end of the lawsuit and large corporations win by dragging on a suit until the small business runs out of money and has to give up. Preventing money from entering the courts in the first place doesnt work because some issues actually are complex and nuanced and require lots of lawyers time to analyse. Having each party contribute equally to their own and their opponents legal fees ensures that complex cases can be sorted out as long as one party is willing to pay for it it ensures that both sides are equal in the eyes of the law and it solves the problems I brought up earlier. In the case of he rich parents paying to get their drunkdriving son off easy they would be forced to contribute an equal amount to the states case allowing the state to effectively fight back and it prevents large corporations bleeding small entities dry because the small entities arent using their own money anymore.

I dont think so because it was in the past. It is over with. I have changed. It is no longer relevant. Why bother bringing up something that will only hurt me and her? In fact it is a good thing she doesnt know she doesnt need to know that specific kind of information. Some say it would be lying. ould be but it is what it is what it is. It isnt hurting anyone and it is information that doesnt need to be said as it is no longer important. Ive changed.

If I go I get a piece of paper and a huge student loan debt. Not to mention the job outlook is very poor the competition is fierce and I will have work experience.

',\n 'First I am coming from a pov that animal rights are absolutely important and talking about people who have that in their interest. Personally I am becoming a vegetarian for moral reasons so this cmv isnt really an attack on vegetarians but something I am genuinely unsure of myself. We need to accept two things universal vegetarianism isnt going to happen soon and if it happens in the future it will probably be due to good quality lab meet or some other fundamental changes in society. Second an individual not eating meat makes zero difference almost. Unless you live on a farm or directly hunt your meat not a single animal is saved. By the time you reject a burger your rejection pretty much only affects you. However that doesnt mean there is no reason to be a vegetarian or to care. One reason is if you are personally so disturbed by knowing what you are eating that you genuinely dont want meat. That is great but we can agree that is a personal reason that might help better you as an individual but wont help the world. Only remaining reason would be contributing to a trend. If restaurants keep getting vegetarian requests they might actually start ordering less meat and that will culminate and the difference might be felt. However it is more likely that while they will develop a better vegetatarian offer the need for meat will only keep increasing with the growing number of population and contributing to the trend of not eating meat at all wont do any difference. However there is a different trend that many meat eaters are getting behind as well and that is caring about where your meat is from and whether the animals were ethically treated. any people arent able to give up meat but they do care about animals. If you go behind this trend you might contribute to making a difference. A restaurant that would otherwise just leave their meat as it is and make a vegetarian option after hearing enough people ask about where the meat is from might totally change their meat suppliers. That is a big difference. The trend would push farms to be more humane if selling otherwise becomes difficult. For a local place being the fifth regular who cares about this could even be enough to make a difference. It just seems like the next realistic goal is getting behind demanding better treatment for animals and that can be achieved if the intended consumers of the meat make these demands. As a vegetarian you are not the consumer and therefore you are not of interest to them. You are really only doing it for yourself and not fighting for anything achiavable. By being a meat consumer your preferences become relevant. ',\n 'If you find yourself uninformed about representatives or issues you should not nor should you be encouraged to vote. This to me seems common sense yet in many or most elections people are attempting to get people to actively vote who otherwise would not such as teachers giving extra credit for voting or businesses offering incentives to employees who vote. I understand people should be encouraged to understand the issue at hand and to research representatives however people who do not should not be encouraged to vote. The reasoning behind this is simply that these choices should not be made at a spur of the moment or without conviction as then we get representatives voted in who hold no qualifications but who the voter may have heard of once or twice. Thank you for your time and I am honestly willing to change my view.

I think the electoral college system sucks balls. I think elections are won one of two ways based on geographic party affiliation i.e. local elections in red states are going to consistently choose the Republican and nothing will change it or based on marketing who runs better ads who has better buzz words like hange and Hope who can come off as the better peopleperson. Neither of these reasons have dick to do with policy. Even the minority of voters who do evaluate the candidates policies are often misguided as elected officials will say one thing prior to being elected and then do another once elected. Finally I think that the general public are idiots. I dont care about my right to complain once my candidate loses I havent been old enough to be directly affected by politics and I find myself somewhere in between political parties and find flaws and benefits to each candidate so I dont really care who wins.

And I recognize that human activity appears to be the main driver of it. But I dont think the consequences will be as dire as are portrayed for humanity. In the following most of my source material is going to come from the IP which is I think a fairly good source for data on this and if anything has an institutional bias in the direction of warning of dire consequences. There are fourthree avenues that I think are of primary concern Sea level rise. The IP estimates a sea level rise in the range of .m over the next century. While thats not trivial its also not dire. ost coastal communities can manage that level of rise with levees and sea walls. Occasionally someone shows a map with a city like New York or iami under a or meter rise in sea levels but the IP estimates give that a very low probability of happening. Drought and other negative impacts on agricultural production. I do not deny that some areas will see reduced rainfall but I dont think that can be true for everywhere indeed it would seem like higher aggregate temperatures would result in more atmospheric water vapor and more aggregate rainfall. So while some areas may be negatively impacted others will be positively impacted. Further weve been getting progressively more efficient agriculturally as time goes on. Across the world the amount of agricultural land per capita has been falling for decades and in developed nations where population growth is slow is falling in absolute terms. See pg. in this IP report This other report on the impact of climate change on crop output says with whats described as medium confidence that Severe weather events. While I dont deny that global warming can cause more severe weather events such as hurricanes I question whether this is a very dire consequence. As our weather forecasting improves and our disaster preparedness improves the loss of life from weather events falls. Even a very bad storm like Katrina was not nearly as devastating to human life as a storm with no warning years before. Further the IP expresses low confidence page of that source that the number of tropical cyclones is measurably impacted by climate change. Its a plausible hypothesis but not one that seems to have been proven yet. So the reason I am looking to see my view possibly changed on this is that I often see people proposing dire consequences and accordingly drastic action of the type that will massively impact standards of living especially among people in developing nations where energy is an enormous part of peoples daily budgets. I dont see the consequences of warming as being severe enough to justify those drastic measures and would like to know if theres something Im missing. Also Im primarily concerned with the impact on humans. While certainly we have to live in the natural environment and so it matters that the environment is in decent shape I see it as more an instrumentality to human wellbeing not an end in itself. For a bit of background Im not a climate scientist and dont have any particular area of expertise in this though I do have a fairly high base level of scientific knowledge and am open to fairly technical rebuttals. ',\n 'ompared to most recreational drugs marijuana has very few apparent negative side effects. Its come down basically makes the user sleepy compared to nauseaheadache with alcohol or mood swings with substances like cocaine or mdma. You are fairly functional while high on marijuana and the drug is relatively cheap. The lack of negative side effects makes it easy for moderate users to become everyday users. Everyday users are more likely on average to lose motivation and become content with short term stimulus compared to achieving longterm goals. Heavy use also tends to lead to a certain amount of dependency where the user has difficulty quitting even if they decide they want to. Where im from anada I see everyday weed smokers for every single alcoholic. I cant help but imagine many of them would be happier had they never smoked weedonly smoked weed moderately. I see alcohol and other drugs as more obviously dangerous and therefore people tend to treat them more carefully or ignore them all together less likely to drink and drive than smoke and drive. I believe that if weed had an unpleasant come down less people would become heavyusers and they would ultimately be happier for it. hange my view.',\n 'This stemmed from my discussion with my friend regarding the Hungarian internet tax.

When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. Ive seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like this is the best spot to get out even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road and then BA. Door prize. This is the passengers fault. . When the driver opens the door into a marked bike lane without ensuring it is safe to do so. Note if the bike lane is positioned correctly it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway so this situation should never exist but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist I think that since the driver had to safely cross a marked bike lane to park their car it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. Thats why in this situation I think its the fault of the dooropener. Now on to my arguement. First off I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time I used to do it full time so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. Im not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort. When I do ride I feel like I ride in a very safe patient predictable fashion. For example I dont pass by cars stopped at intersections because I dont feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. Ill sit directly behind them in line with their license plate and Ill let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic sudden unexpected pass. If I cant get directly behind them Ill still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. ars have many blind spots and motorists cant be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor whats in front of them while making a turn. Not even the best mostattentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. Were all in this together. Doorprizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like People have to watch out for me in blank situation! Im not at all going to help them not make a mistake in blank situation just because Im not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them.. I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Heres why . Even the best most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be doorprized. You can shoulder check mirror check or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast then they can be difficult to see until its too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door. . Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why? Because a driver cant be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly its just as reasonable to say cyclists it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because its not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They dont expect traffic right next to them when they are parked. . The cyclist for their own safety should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous and someone hurts them as a result then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations. . Doorprizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make and its much easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the doorprize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the to seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them even if the driver is preoccupied in a rush distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car etc.. Keep in mind youre not just teaching drivers youd have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also I think youd be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are aware of whats next to you. Youre lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did. Finally a cyclist might argue sometimes I need to cycle in the doorprize lane because theres not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left. In that situation you should simply take the lane which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is legal you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble taking the lane. If cars need to pass and youd prefer to not have them sit behind you you can move over into the doorprize lane and stop and wait until its reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again. The hazard of riding near parked cars is incredibly obvious to the cyclist but the hazard of opening the car door is not so obvious to the dooropener because of human nature and what we are taught. The cyclist has more control over where heshe rides than we have control over our occasional forgetfulness or ignorance especially while doing something as innocent to our brain as opening a door no matter how hard we try or how responsible and cautious of a person we are. The cyclist is knowingly and deliberately doing something that is wellunderstood to be quite dangerous when there are alternatives even if you are forced into the doorlane you can always ride slowly there or even come to a stop if thats what it takes to ride safely while the dooropener is unknowingly and accidentally doing something dangerously that . of the time is safe and harmless. ',\n 'Before I start I dont believe the above in all cases. Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the dooropener . When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. Ive seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like this is the best spot to get out even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road and then BA. Door prize. This is the passengers fault. . When the driver opens the door into a marked bike lane without ensuring it is safe to do so. Note if the bike lane is positioned correctly it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway so this situation should never exist but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist I think that since the driver had to safely cross a marked bike lane to park their car it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. Thats why in this situation I think its the fault of the dooropener. Now on to my arguement. First off I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time I used to do it full time so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. Im not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort. When I do ride I feel like I ride in a very safe patient predictable fashion. For example I dont pass by cars stopped at intersections because I dont feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. Ill sit directly behind them in line with their license plate and Ill let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic sudden unexpected pass. If I cant get directly behind them Ill still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. ars have many blind spots and motorists cant be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor whats in front of them while making a turn.

',\n 'The title says it all. y nation the United States has a long history of controversy in regards to marriage. Up until  interracial marriage was illegal in many states. Today I suspect most of the public supports the legality of interracial marriage. Since  Plural marriages known mostly for the practices association with the ormon church has been illegal. Then of course in recent years theres been the controversy over gay marriage George W. Bush putting opposition into law and over course his successor Barack Obama pushing in the opposite direction. Personally I just dont see why these issues are any business of the government. During the debate over gay marriage the slippery slope argument was often cited that if you legalize gay marriage next thing you know women will be wanting to marry a zebra or something. Personally I say if the Zebra can sign the documents and take the vows who am I to stand in the way of love? Frankly I dont see it as my business. The issue of plural marriage is more controversial its been associated with abuse forced marriage sexual assault of minors. But to my mind it would be more sensible to pass laws against abuse forced marriage and sexual assault than to ban plural marriage which does not inherently include any of this. y opinion is this I see no advantage and significant disadvantage to Government regulation of marriage. The marriage contract at its heart is just a civil contract that comes with tax incentives and a few other incentives such as inheritance rights and the ability to visit loved ones in the hospital. This contract should be governed by the people who want to enter into it and subject to no more or less restriction and oversight than other contracts. I invite you to change my view Full disclosure I am currently in a polyamorous relationship with a partner I would very much like to marry some day but who also has another partner whom she would also like to marry someday. Obviously this would not currently be legal.',\n 'Everybody is always freaking out about Fructose in some form or another and I realize that a lot of the crap companies like put out and market as fruit juice is really just fruit drink plus tons of sugar but if I just eat a zillion raw apples for the rest of my life will that really give me Type Diabetes? Will it hurt me at all? What about all those health nuts on allfruit diets or whatever? Shouldnt their blood be running thicker than molasses? It just seems like the most counterintuitive thing to me fruits which are high in sugar are also generally considered one of the healthiest things you can possibly be eating or feed to your children or whatever. So whats the deal? y instinct is that scare stories about natural fructose are total nonsense but I have zero science to back this view up in terms of how that sugar actually affects my body. So ? ',\n 'First of all Ill point out that there are government services such as police forces and public libraries which Im glad to pay for. There are also many many uses of taxes of which I disapprove examples war electricity for accent lighting at government buildings negligible but wasteful in principle and the death penalty. Im forced to pay at least partially for all of these things and offered no way to choose where my money goes. Apparently I consented to these conditions by being born. If I refuse to pay taxes Im fined. If I refuse to pay the fine Im eventually sent to prison. If I refuse to go to prison Im physically transported there. If I attempt to leave I will probably eventually end up being bodily harmed. Im not sure how so many people condone this. y main complaint is that I will eventually end up in physical danger if I refuse to fund warfare while remaining in my home. This is fundamentally wrong. ',\n 'Often I hear the decision to not have a child described as selfish but I see it the other way around. When you become a parent your brain chemistry changes and you biochemically become a completely different person. Youve crossed the void and theres no going back your life is your childs and no longer your own. This is why parents can deal with babys crying and pooping and general nastiness because you are evolutionarily primed to love your child that much. Having a child is objectively a bad decision economically timewise etc. However the emotions that come with parenthood are indescribable for those without kids it truly is a drug. Not having child is objectively a great decision economically timewise etc. However you miss out on what a significant part of the human experience. oreover it is much easier to fall into a life that feels purposeless without a child as an easy answer. When I weigh the two together I cant help but come to the conclusion that having a child getting high off of parenthood and creating conscious and needy life is more selfish than using the resources you would use on the child to better the world. I am making the assumption that instead of childbearing the wouldbe parent involves him or herself in some sort of meaningful charity work. I also want to be clear that Im not saying that having a child makes you a selfish person or even that having a child is necessarily selfish in and of itself. y view states only that it is more selfish than abstaining from parenthood. Full disclosure I am childless extremely young and completely unqualified to have a legitimate opinion on this topic. Im not sure if I want children or not but I dont want it to be a flippant decision. Interested to hear from some parents and others with more experience. ',\n 'Im not saying that U.S. democracy or any specific democracy is the best or better than any other other government but rather that democracy or the idea that every individual should matter and get a say through some kind of vote and that public officials should be held responsible for their actions with that vote is the best political system to date for preventing corruption and promoting social equality and liberty. Sure there is a nearly endless list of democracys shortcomings and failures and the U.S. is an especially good example of how tyranny and atrocity can continue or even worsen under a supposedly democratic government. However I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under nondemocratic governments. When I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets. onversely if for example the U.S. had been a oneparty dictatorship for the past years atrocities such as chattel slavery genocide of indigenous peoples and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse if imagining such is even possible. I want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because thats where I am also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy. I believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy. Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is obsolete or just a bad idea in the first place. When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others. hange my view! Ok there have been a lot of requests for me to pin things down better and define my view Id say it has changed a little since I first posted but here it is Democracy is any form of government concerned with the idea of giving more people say more people equality more people freedom. So for example the U.S. falls short of these things in many ways and at many times but at least it is founded on the premise of expanding the categories that receive citizenship. At the founding of the U.S. citizenship was incredibly limited but it was still a far larger category of participants than european monarchy. So Democracy is dynamic and you can have moments in the same systemgovernmentculture that are democratic and undemocratic. y belief is the idea that the moments that best represent the will of the people are best for governance overall.

At the founding of the U.S. citizenship was incredibly limited but it was still a far larger category of participants than european monarchy. So Democracy is dynamic and you can have moments in the same systemgovernmentculture that are democratic and undemocratic. y belief is the idea that the moments that best represent the will of the people are best for governance overall. Ok so far thank you all for a some interesting debates. This is my first time as OP on so please forgive my amateurish blunders. After some contemplation and review I have come to the conclusion that my prompt is too ambiguous that in order to have a fruitful I need to choose specifically what I am defending. If that is representative democracy then so be it. I may have pulled a bit too much of a No true Scotsman here. ',\n 'Revenge porn can be extremely hurtful there is no doubt about that. But so can other behaviors by resentful lovers such as gossip cheating backstabbing betrayal and financial exploitation. I know people who have committed suicide because of those things yet we dont consider them crimes. Why? Because relationships are deeply private affairs and it is no business of the state to dictate their terms. These laws will do very little to help victims of revenge porn. For a successful prosecution there has to be solid proof that it was the exlover who published the pictures and not some random hacker. But any disgruntled exlover who has a minimum of computer literacy knows how to publish pictures in an untraceable manner. Only the most stupid perpetrators will be caught. At the same time such laws are easy to abuse. I shudder at the inevitable cases of revenge revenge porn where lovers verbally consent to publish naked pictures and then change their mind once the relationship goes sour. Then there is also the problem that these laws are too vague. What is considered porn is in the eye of the beholder. I know women who would be extremely hurt if their exlover published a picture of them wearing lingerie. I know other women who would not even shrug their shoulders. Worst off all these laws will poison relationships because they promote paranoia towards the people who are closest to us. There are already libelslander laws to deal with this kind of behavior. We dont need illconceived and rushed revenge porn laws. They are a threat to civil liberties.

I felt convinced by Sam Harris that Islam was one of the most harmful religions ever until he was on Bill ahers show. After watching that and The Young Turks analysis of it and interview of Reza Azlan who I think is a liar Im no longer so sure. If someone tells me that my life style ideology or whatever is going to destroy the world I could understand having the perspective that that person is going to kill me unless if I kill them first. I dont condone any religion but I think fearing them without adequately understanding them is more dangerous than the religion itself. Of the billion or so uslims I truly believe most dont care about apostates and have no desire to strap a bomb to themselves. It seems to me like they are just worried about getting the groceries for their family trying to get by in this world which can be very difficult depending on where they are in the world.',\n 'Any person dying is a tragedy. That said the anadian soldiers recently killed are receiving an undue amount of compassion and attention. Sports events are opening with tributes flags are being flown and Americanstyle jingoism is mounting. A total of anadian Forces personnel have been killed in the Afghanistan war since . And yet a couple soldiers die on home turf and this is a gamechanger. We now have tearjerking articles about a dead soldiers dogs This qualifies as selective empathy. When has anyone cared so much in anada for those who have died in action often people who were not soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the greater good. I firmly believe that this kind of selective empathy when coupled with media fanning and fawning is toxic for our society and resultant local and international policy. .

',\n 'Ive seen a million studies that show women make less. Ive seen a million studies that show men make less. And Ive seen a million studies that show everyone makes about the same. I think every study that shows that one gender makes more than the other is incomplete or fallacious and I strongly believe that most studies are done by people who are looking for a particular outcome to prove what they already hope to be true. When considering all aspects of employment wages hours worked benefits experience occupation and anything else that could be a factor I seriously believe that men and women probably make a very similar number a number so similar that there are no grounds for advocating either gender needs more pay. I am equally willing to believe that men make less money as I am to believe women make less money. ',\n 'y view On average women are less capable at defending against a physical attack than their male counterparts. By allowing all eligible citizens to access firearms you neutralise this disadvantage women have. By preventing all eligible citizens from legally accessing firearms you have a disproportionate affect upon women. Thus access to firearms should be considered a gender equality issue. Notes I am a year old Irish male. Gun control is an issue that interests me but there is not much opportunity for discussion amongst my peers as we dont have much of a gun culture here. Although I enjoy discussing many of the aspects around gun control I would like to limit this to the view stated. ',\n 'I am a hiropractic student as of moment and I firmly believe that only edical Doctors should hold the title of doctor to reduce confusion to as what the practitioner can treat. This extends to anyone with a doctorate in the medical profession though. A doctor of physical therapy anyone with a doctorate in nursing or pharmacy or anything else for that matter. If you havent gone to medical school and graduated with a .D. you shouldnt be referred to as doctor in a clinical setting. This reduces confusion to as what everyone does and firmly implants in the patients mind what your specialty is and your scope of practice instead of ambiguously being called doctor.

The word sport should be reserved for activities that are physically demanding. Darts Snooker and hess perhaps a few others should be classed as games as while they require skill andor intelligence they do not have the physical aspect that almost every other sport does. I rarely see fat professional tennis players but I have seen a few somewhat overweight snooker and darts players. I think a lot of the oncoming debate will be about whose definition of sport we go by. Perhaps my approach of defining sport as something physically active is a tad... out there... but I dont see why it shouldnt be the case. ',\n 'As above. The way I see it a persons writing and grammar skills are the data equivalent of their speaking and oratory skills in a facetoface setting. uch as we mock cajole or otherwise poke fun at people when they misspeak we insult deride and tease those who wrt lik dis cuz why shud i bother i mean u unrstnd rite? Speak like a idiot in public and people will harass you about it until you fix the habit. I understand that some may feel that its unnecessarily cruel or mean to hurt peoples feelings over something as simple as their writing style but I feel quite the opposite. As a species that puts great stock in our intelligence and our ability to communicate we should harangue those who are unable to accurately communicate. TLDR that an inability to spell correctly use correct grammar and choose the most appropriate words for the meaning you wish to convey is something you should be ridiculed for until you stop making these mistakes.

The Rapture has just occurred so the world has ended and joy! Youve just arrived at the pearly gates of Biblical heaven. Everything is awesome. FUKING awesome. As doctrinally promised you retain more or less the physical form that you had on Earth but obviously in its absolute peak devoid of previous imperfections. Your mind too is better than it was before much better. You can do whatever you want in total bliss and comfort surrounded by the creme de la creme the best people who ever lived not to mention your main man J and The Big an Upstairs. Youre stoked. Eternity is going to be SWEET. Fastforward a thousand Earth years. Youve been in Heaven a pretty long time now but youre still having an awesome time. Youve met a lot of people but theres plenty more to meet. After all on Earth there were around billion hristians. Not all of them would have been good hristians but even if only of them did a good enough job to get into Heaven thats still million people and surely the proportion of good hristians is more than ! Furthermore since you all would have followed the Bible pretty closely youre all going to have quite a lot in common so you just know youre going to get on well with them. Its not just the people of course. Theres so much to enjoy in Heaven too! Anything you can imagine can be achieved and as youre at your complete best ALL THE TIE your imagination is working on overdrive! This is SWEET! Now fastforward ten billion Earth years. Even operating at your absolute peak imagination you ran out of original ideas for shit to do about lets be generous here years after you arrived at the gates. That was and a half billion years ago. Youre really bored of your own mind now. Remember the Bible promised you that YOU that is a semblance of the limited being that lived on earth and earned its way to heaven would get to Heaven so even in your Heavenly form you must also be in some way limited. You get to share in the ideas of lots of other people too though. Lets be SUPER generous here and pretend that even though youre all hristians and therefore at least to some degree think in similar ways each individual person has another years worth of original material in their minds. After TEN BILLION YEARS the thought of doing new stuff all the time isnt quite as fun as it used to be. You never get physically tired or mentally drained in the way a limited human being would on Earth. Even so you are experiencing things similarly to how your Earthly self would have that is through your five senses and through your emotions thats how the promise of Heaven is explained in the Bible remember as an extension of Earthly pleasures. The possible positive combinations that you can experience in these ways are starting to be exhausted. Its not quite so sweet anymore. Now fast forward a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years. Youre still in a semblance of your Earthly form still experiencing Heaven through a semblance of your Earthly mind. Nothing and nobody is new. Not only is it not new but youve experienced everything so many trillions of times that pleasure joy and other positive emotions no matter how Biblically epic no longer have any meaning for you. Time means nothing. Other beings mean nothing even God who according to the Bible is so unknowable and infinite that He could never mean anything much to a humanish mind to begin with. Again you never physically or mentally tire in Heaven those are clear Earthly limitations so there is no sleep for you in a human sense. Which is a pity because sleep would be a refuge from the only emotion you could possibly be experiencing at this time boredom. Endless unimaginable boredom. If only there was some way you could close your eyes and sleep forever fade into nothingness. If only death were really real. The closest you can get to the comfort of nothingness of death is to float in an empty space eyes closed thinking of nothing. You especially try to avoid the one thought that claws at the back of your mind the thought that even after a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years you are not even . through your time in Heaven. You will literally be here for eternity. This is the reality of the hristian afterlife as I understand it. In my view death an infinite nothingness would be way way better. hange my view.

Take the misinformation of alvins dad for example Why would you ever want to lead your children astray like this? Because they cant handle the truth until theyre older? Why not just tell them the truth in the first place? What are you protecting them from? Why not answer every question with scientific accuracy instead of lying to them? Are you not their teacher? Why lead them down a road of ignorance? All of these lies in this list can be circumvented in a constructive way and it is the responsibility of the parent to find that with truth. Regarding the Santa lie Ive heard people say that the day they discovered the truth about Santa was the day their childhood ended. I dont think prolonging the magic of Santa and belief is what makes children children. I think its the curiosity and playfulness that defines them. The only way to healthily encourage that is with truth. Denying the inevitable truth about death and sex will do more damage than not. Perhaps this is the reason so many people are scared of it. Perhaps they wouldnt be if they learned to come to terms with the world around them while theyre still plastic.

Animals do not know any better so they cannot be blamed for their actions i.e. hunting and eating other animals I would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings is that criminals can effectively be taught to know better. Therefore a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are it is natural for them to hunt.

Several times a day up and down our shared fence little collar bells jingling all day long and they are at least of them. Once their little one got lost and so all night we helped try to find him. Turned out he had roamed into our garage while it had been open and he was just fine. The next time he went missing sadly he stayed missing and has not been seen since I searched my garage thoroughly of course. The neighbors themselves are on the nosy side and prone to vague accusations of people theyve known around the neighborhood for petty things like missing trashcans mail etc. Im ok to keep our distance. aintaining the friendly neighbor banter yes...asking them any favors no. To have bird feeders out that I enjoy I have to also put up with even more cat traffic. I have no idea if they are pooping or peeing in my yard its river rocks no grass. y husband is allergic so its not like we can get all cuddly with them and make friends. They are really a nuisance to us but we are trying to be good neighbors. I am not against cats in general but I feel like we are part of their living area and didnt get a choice. I am even thinking of it in terms of tit for tat i.e. what they have to put up with from us. We are all professional musicians and so there is practicing going on at times but we are not rockers or excessively loud. We also have a dog but she walks to go potty and doesnt use the outside very much. She gets along with cats who arent aggressive towards her. Thats about it. I guess this is more rhelpmecope but I could use some positive thoughts about shared custody cats... ',\n 'Gender as defined by Wikipedia is the range of characteristics pertaining to and differentiating between masculinity and femininity. This notion of gender creates an unhealthy dichotomy between what defines a man and what defines a woman. It forces people to associate with one of two extremes that are not clearly defined universally or objectively. Through traditional stereotypes of masculinity and femininity gender creates a categorization of behaviors qualities and images as belonging either to men or women. Any man who aligns with the female gender or any woman who aligns with the male gender then is an an exception to the definition of a man or woman as defined by society. Sex and sexual orientation are the only concepts of importance. Although there are some rare exceptions a person is classified biologically as either male or female. A man who assumes a feminine gendered identity is still a man and a woman who assumes a masculine gendered identity is still a woman regardless of their character or orientation. The problem lies not within people being born in the wrong skin but within societys narrow definitions of men and women and of masculinity and femininity. hange my view.',\n 'I see very little difference between killing a pig for its meat and killing a dog for fun. To change my view you will need to either convince me that there is a significant fundamental difference between the two or that its ok to kill dogs for fun. As someone who really enjoys eating meat I would really like for my view to be changed. I have spoken with a few people about this in the hopes that they would convince me that its ok to continue eating meat but so far the arguments have been entirely unconvincing. Id like to preemptively address some arguments that I do not find compelling. . People need to eat to survive therefore eating meat is morally acceptable. I do not find this answer compelling because we do not have to eat meat to survive. We can live perfectly healthy lives without eating any meat. Eating meat is certainly enjoyable to many people but that is hardly a justification. Some people enjoy killing dogs and I dont consider that an acceptable justification. . Eating meat is natural. We have been doing it since we were cavemen. Raping people is also natural and we have also been doing it since we were cavemen. . We have domesticated some animals to the point where they cannot survive in nature. If we were to not raise them for consumption they would go extinct. I am not sure that I am really opposed to the extinction of species that cannot survive in nature but if I were I suppose we could make a small nature preserve where cows pigs and chickens live. If you are going to complain about the cost rest assured that the cost would be far outweighed by our consumption of more efficient food. . If the animals are raised in a humane way and slaughtered painlessly and without causing them any fear whats the problem? Im not sure why I feel like it is wrong. But I do know that if someone liked to adopt puppies treat them humanely and then execute them in a painless manner just for fun it seems morally reprehensible to me. aybe someone can explain why I feel this way or convince me that its ok. . Killing dogs for fun is ok because they dont have a soul or arent selfaware or something like that. I dont think there is anything fundamentally different about a dog and a human that would make it ok to kill one and not the other without a pretty good reason. . What about fish? What about eggs? What about spinach? Its alive too. You have to draw the line somewhere. Thats true. Im not sure where the line should be but I do know that pigs are as smart and adorable as dogs so I dont see why any rules of morality should extend to one and not the other. . Animals kill other animals for food. Is that immoral? any animals do not have a choice but to eat meat. In those cases it is not immoral for them to kill for food. In the cases of animals that are perfectly capable of subsisting without killing I would say that they are behaving in an immoral way but I dont blame them since they probably lack the reasoning capacity to think about this situation from the other creatures point of view.

If a procedure is expensive unavailable or illegal in a persons country of residence it could be anything from cosmetic surgery to various dental procedures to abortions and euthanasia an alternative is to fly to a country which provides the service under more desirable conditions. In my opinion government regulation of this industry constitutes a violation of personal liberty undermines the economic growth of the prospective destination countries and inflates the price of domestic healthcare by forcibly eliminating foreign competition. Examples of regulation include limiting travel to government approved zones countries etc limiting the kinds of treatment allowed e.g. banning certain procedures deemed to dangerous or perhaps banning travel for procedures which are illegal in the country like abortions or euthanasia making the buying of insurance to cover the procedure compulsory and so on. It could also be controlled by the receiving countries in a third world country a government may not want scarce medical worker resources going toward rich white people.',\n 'Yes I did a search and I didnt find anything but please advise me if that has been covered.

It is also uncomfortable for other people as the person in front of me usually cannot recline their seat and has to deal with my knees in their back and the persons next to me often have to put up with my feet in their footwell as they cannot fit anywhere else. It can also be dangerous if I am wedged in a seat as I often am I am less able to move freely in case of evacuation and could also block other people in my row. y height is not a disability nor an abnormality. I am able to lead a completely normal life and have no difficulties or hindrances in almost any other walk of life. It is also something I have absolutely no control over and something that cannot be changed. As such it is my view that where available on airliners I should be able to access seats with extra legroom at no extra cost. In many airlines it is the case that one can purchase seats with extra legroom and no other change or increase in service. In these cases I think tall people should be offered these seats without having to pay the extra charge. Of course tall people can waive their right to these seats if they want to make sure they sit next to their travelling companions but the offer should be made. I dont mind how airlines decide how to implement this whether by visual inspection when you check in requiring you to be measured I wouldnt mind having my height measured to be able to fly in minimum comfort when allocating seats or any other method. However I think that the desires of those who pay for extra leg room should not outweigh the need of tall people to fit in their seat and that as long as someone is over a certain height which the airline could determine based on their knowledge of their seating arrangements they should be offered a chance to sit somewhere with enough space for them without any extra cost. At the very least I think emergency and even bulkhead row seats should not be sold at an extra premium and should be reserved for tall people. If there are no tall by the airlines definition passengers then they could be allocated to anyone who is lucky enough. If an airline wishes to make profit of extra leg room seats they should install seats with extra leg room and should no be allowed to make their profit at the expense of people who literally cannot help how tall they are. !

However Im sure I havent thought of all sides of the issue and would be interested in other points of view. y reasoning I believe that if you have the means you should be responsible for yourself and minimize the amount you take from others. This includes not only current living costs but future needs such as retirement and health care. I want to minimize the amount I take from public and private assistance freeing that money up for people who really need it. A disaster can happen at any time and can be incredibly expensive. In the US this is most likely to be a health issue. I also want to be able to help my family and friends if they need it. While one could argue that charity recipients are no less deserving than my family and I agree I think we all have a unique responsibility to those closest to us. If I gave to everyone who deserved it I would go broke. I dont have kids currently but I might some day and its better to start saving as early as possible. Because of this I think the best option is to save as much as I can letting it grow throughout my life and then give whatever is left to charity in my will. For what its worth Im neither rich nor poor. I make above the median individual income but less than the median household income.

I have a good number of friends Ive dealt with some anxiety that used to drag me down and Im much more confident in social situations. Im passionate about a lot of different things hobbies consuming media gaining more and more knowledge. Im planning on going to university for a subject about which Im very excited to learn and although itll be a lot of work Im expecting university to be a huge amount of fun as well a whole new social life a new setting different activities and most of all freedom. However based on pretty much all descriptions of adulthood that Ive read things arent very good after that. Ive heard many times that people end up in office jobs that are mentally draining and that whatever subject they were passionate about in school has become monotonous and dull. I know that many adults have a really hard time keeping up a social life and trying to improve it is difficult. Ive also read that as you age your perception of passing time changes and the years seem to slip by in an instant. I think thats one of the scariest things Ive ever heard. Right now I love so many things about my life and I want to believe that as an adult Ill be doing something I enjoy and still doing the things that I enjoy now having friends writing music reading great books and watching great movies. But based on what Ive read theres a chance Im going to become this a person who works all day at a job thats tiring who comes home feeling exhausted every day who does something during the evening that doesnt require much thinking like watching T and who goes to sleep early in order to be a little less exhausted the next day. Someone who has some friends from university still but doesnt see them very often maybe once or twice a year and otherwise doesnt do much socially. Someone who although they might not notice isnt really doing anything and wont be for the rest of their life. I really dont want this to be true. Ive met some adults who are amazing people and whose lives seem interesting beyond anything I could want. However I know that many adults arent like that at all they become static people and that could very well happen to me. hange my view.

There might be a simplelogical reason we males are allowed to thats why Im here.

Ive never been a father but I still dont see that having any weight in the matter. And also ',\n 'I feel very strongly that the main motivation for these killers isnt the pleasure they get from murdering kids but the shock and disgust they subject the public to. They are psychopathic and horribly depressed and instead of killing themselves outright they want to release some of the pain they have felt onto the world. So far the media has played along exactly as these people want. They turn these people into celebrities and for months after every shooting every media outlet talks about the shooting non stop. Edgy people on the Internet spread the persons picture around as part of some ironic joke all the churches across the country hold daily prayer services or whatever. The whole country gets completely worked up and panicky and this is exactly what the shooter wants. The part that makes me the most angry is that a news station or magazine directly profits from publishing every single scrap of information they can get their hands on. Youll see pictures of the shooter from years before the event took place. These tragedies result in a profit for whatever news organization can deliver the most info to the grieving public perpetuating the state of panic for longer and fulfilling these sick murderers fantasies. It might sound drastic but if a law was passed that treated these people like terrorists and forbid the media to give into their demands I feel that the amount of shootings would go down. or at least tell my why making a law about it would be a bad idea.',\n 'Just because a housewife doesnt earn papers with numbers on them doesnt mean she doesnt do anything. arried guys of reddit imagine if your wife would stop being there.

For instance coming up with ideas being rigorous and being an expert does not make you a scientist. This is not to say that ideation rigor and expertise are not neccessary just that you do not have science with without something to test and the means to test it. As an aside another concern I had was that we give credence to the creation of ideas without the process then you are labeling a process science with its associated authority when it should not have that authority. Ultimately the value of science is in how it tests our understanding of the world so why should we allow ourselves to call the entirety of our research efforts science?

She will often make sandwiches with soy coldcuts or heat up some veggie chicken nuggets. Now I have no problem with vegetarian food. I love tofu. I love seitan. Soy chorizo is amazing. Even those fake chicken nuggets dont taste too badly. However the soy cold cuts? Fakin bacon? No thanks. That said I really believe that vegetarian food should be doing its own thing instead of attempting to mimic meat. I understand some of the reasons for such products they help meat eaters transition and they also play nicely with existing recipes items in your pantry etc. However in order to elevate vegetarian food the thought of mimicking meat should be abandoned vegetarian proteins and other food should be treated as their own ingredient and utilized as such. The desire to mimic meat products often neglects that particular ingredients ideal usage. I do recognize that there are cases where these concepts overlap and are not mutually exclusive. If an ideal usage of a vegetarian inredient just so happens to be in the same form as a meat product so be it. eggie burgers comes to mind Ive had some incredible black bean burgers. But fakin bacon? Tofu in the shape of a turkey? These are obscenities against food and vegetarians deserve better.

Ive worked in most sorts of positions from fast food fry cook to fine dining server and later as a general manager. As a rule I tip very well For an exceptional experience . Thats right If my server is truly exceptional Ill tip of the meals price. If the server is very very good . For service that is average . Even a server that I would describe as meh who makes a mistake or two perhaps but is polite and clearly making an effort in good faith will earn the standard of from me. I will not tip less than . That said if a server is simply bad meaning that they are dismissive rude overly forgetful inattentive smelly or something like that I will not leave them a tip. People who are bad servers simply do not deserve to be tipped and they certainly do not deserve to be tipped well. I know that they live off of their tips but thats really the point They shouldnt be able to live off of tips if they are simply bad at their job. Their misery and the misery of the patrons at their establishment will only be prolonged if they are allowed to earn a living wage doing something for which they are clearly illsuited. In the long run they will be betteroff if they are encouraged to find something else by their inability to support themselves being a server. Unfortunately many restaurant managers are insufficiently proactive in terminating bad employees. The little push of being stiffed only aids in quickening turnover that management should probably be taking into their own hands but dont. As an aside expediting the exit of poor servers will only serve to keep positions open for those who have an aptitude or would do the job well through hard work. ore people should stiff bad servers it seems as Im finding them to be more and more common. hange my view!

Act in Wisconsin appears to have resulted in huge benefits to the taxpayers including more teachers in classrooms and a balanced budget at least according to Wikipedia. I would love to understand how my view may be wrong and whether there are drawbacks for the taxpayers in taking away the right of public employees to collective bargaining. It seems like a very easy way to bring more accountability to jobs that lack that accountability such as police while saving taxpayers money and balancing the budget.

So please change my view ',\n 'The most important function of an ASII smiley face is to indicate the emotion that it is intended to convey. Thus the parenthesis sign is the critical element of the ASII emotion as it is the indicator of emotion. Almost all languages use the lefttoright writing convention so it is logical for the parenthesis to come first as it is the most critical component. Also a fallacious smiley face could be syntactically confusing if placed at the end of a sentence because it fuses with whatever punctuation that the sentence contains. The superior orientation does not share this downside. ost humans are right handed so they would naturally tilt their heads to the right. If looking at a mirror image of oneself and tilting their head to the right the smiley would naturally be oriented in the fashion. I know that some of you will invariably argue for the photographic version instead of the mirror image version but most people look at themselves in the mirror more often than in photos. On the keyboard itself it is much more natural to go from a higher key to a lower key rather than the other way around. So it is actually more convenient to type as well. ',\n 'urrently if this situation were to arise the shooter would be awarded an assist. Say a defenseman takes a shot from the blueline and it glances off the shin guard of the center in front of the net the center would be awarded the goal despite whether or not he made an attempt to redirect the puck. I think goals should only be awarded to those that make a deliberate attempt to move the puck towards the net. I doesnt really matter since assissts and goals are both worth a point in their stat line but saying someone is a goal scorer as opposed to a goal scorer holds considerable weight in contract negotiations. ',\n 'By information I mean things like software music movies photographs or anything that can be replicated infinitely. Dont get me wrong I do believe in laws that encourage creativity. I believe that an individual who creates something like a song or an algorithm or a painting deserves to be credited and paid if herhis work profits someone. I also believe in laws for privacy. If you keep some information in a private storage and some one replicates it without authorization it is a crime. But photographs unlike a loaf of rye bread cannot be stolen. all it a different kind of crime maybe pirating we do not have as many swashbuckling seafarers around so that word is up for grabs? This is mere semantics so it is not a big deal. However patents and copyright are not property in the sense that cars are. They are simply documentation describing an idea and ascribing credit. The creator understandably is granted the right to control the use of the idea for a time. I find it hard to understand what is meant by selling a patent or a copyright. That the original patent holder authored the idea is a fact which cannot be changed. What does it mean for them to sell their rights to the idea away? If a third party allegedly buys these rights why should society feel compelled to credit and compensate them for its use? I think that we have become so used to thinking about legality in terms of possession that we apply such a model even to things that dont quite fit. Treating information as property creates dangerous entities like patent trolls which do not create anything but merely buy and sell information for profit.

Im always hearing stories about how people threaten to rape and kill people on twitter and telling people to kill themselves purely based on them having a different opinion than them I see it all the time on forums and stuff too and its often up voted by people. Its also the little things that get to me like in an online game I play its usually considered polite to say good luck have fun at the beggining of the game and good game at the end which I always do since I try to be a nice person but it seems like of the time people dont do this and often tell me to kill myself and other things instead. Plus if you look at the most subscribed youtube channels pretty much all of them are filled with some of the most stupid immature rubbish but it still gets millions of views. I dont see people acting like this that often in real life but thats the thing people can act however they want to online since theyre anonymous lots of people act like how Ive been talking about while I try to be a nice person because why wouldnt I? I really hate making other people feel especially for no reason. I try very hard to be a nice person which I guess is both my biggest strength and weakness. Ive often tried to be generous with buying things for people like steam games or just letting them keep any money they owe me etc but it seems like people often take advantage of that. One time I decided to give someone a game on steam since they got a new pc just as a friendly gesture but they never gave me anything back that wasnt the reason I gave them something I just feel like I would of done if I was them they just kept asking me If I had anymore games for them and then unfriended me when I didnt give them any Also when I was at school there was a very sweet boy with adhd people used to be really mean to him and do things like hide his clothes and spray deodorant in his face I just dont get it. how can people act like that? A few months ago a popular youtube games critic made a vlog saying that he had got cancer the point of the video was saying that he made a stupid mistake didnt get himself checked when he was having problems and didnt want other people to make the same mistake. I found tons of posts and comments often upvoted ones pretty much laughing at him and saying that it was karma because one got angry when someone was harassing him and his family online. He know people would act like this and he was most likely very embarrassed by it but he wanted to do something selfless he was worse of for making that video and the people laughing at him were enjoying laughing at him. The worst part to me is that it seems like the people who try to be nice often get screwed over and the opposite happens to the idiots. I try to convince myself its just the vocal minority but judging by how often I see people acting like this then I struggle to believe it especially with my point about the popular youtube channels. It may not sound like much and I probably sound pretty arrogant when I say it but I have to be honest and things build up a lot I guess. basically it seems like its the majority or atleast very close that seem to act like this now and not just the vocal minority. sorry about the poor wording in some of this Im not used to writing anything longer than a comment.

The idea that you should spend half or more of a yearly income on a wedding ring is the most disgusting financial advice I have ever heard.

If you are making median wage you should be aiming for a nice several hundred dollar ring. If you are earning six figures thats when you get into thousand dollar rings. I do not believe anybody should be spending relatively huge quantities of money on wedding rings particularly diamonds since by now we all know how disgusting the entire diamond industry is. While were at it separate engagement rings are even worse. ',\n 'I cant STAND people who talk about this sort of thing. The idea that you should spend half or more of a yearly income on a wedding ring is the most disgusting financial advice I have ever heard. I absolutely believe how much you spend on your wedding ring ought to be proportional to how much you earn. But this is for the opposite reason. If you are making median wage you should be aiming for a nice several hundred dollar ring. If you are earning six figures thats when you get into thousand dollar rings.

While were at it separate engagement rings are even worse. ',\n 'I came across an article about a young white woman who wanted to cosplay as a black character from Walking Dead. I sense that it is a tricky topic but I cant really get to a reasonable explanation as to why it is not okay to dress up as a character from a different race and to try to get closer to that look by painting over the colour of your skin provided you dont just dress as a caricature of a certain race of course. Wouldnt true equality only be reached if changing the colour of your skin was no bigger deal than wearing a wig in a different hair colour? Why should you only be allowed to dress as a character of your own ethnicity? Please remember I am only trying to find a reasonable explanation for this principle and am not trying to condone racial stereotyping or anything of the sort. If I am ignorant for asking this well at least I bothered to ask.',\n 'Now before I begin I want to make it clear that I am not the stereotypical sports jock who puts down nontraditional sports like cheerleading and marching band. I am currently in high school marching band and have never been good at any actual sports. A sport has always been a competitive activity that involves either individuals or teams competing against each other to win a game or match. Sports have clear winners that can be determined by either the amount of points an individual or team wins ex football soccer tennis etc. or which individual or team finishes first ex swim track etc.. Therefore anything that cannot be determined to have a clear winner should not be considered a sport. Even if you dont accept this definition there is a clear difference between artistic activities and athletic activities. Athletic events require mostly physical fitness and coordination and have a clear winner. Artistic events like marching band and dance may require physical activity but mostly utilize ones creative interpretation. Additionally artistic events cannot be judged objectively and artistic competitions almost always have judges who use their own subjection to determine the winners. Now for some reason there has been a strange push in the last decade or so to define just about any and all extracurricular activities as sports especially in high schools. When meeting someone in high school instead of asking what that person enjoys to do the primary question seems to be what sports do you play. While this isnt really part of my main argument I think a possible reason for this trend is the desire from students to feel included in the world of sports despite not being good enough for traditional sports. ',\n 'By social contract I refer to the thought that individuals hold moral or political obligations toward each other and the state as a result of a shared contract that forms society. The premise of my argument is this I did not sign any social contract and until I consent to such a thought I hold no obligations to the society I am in at the time or the government that claims to represent them simply because I have a natural right to decide to not give my consent to something or not. This naturally means that government is illegitimate if it tries to rule me in any way. If I need to formulate a natural rights theory in this thread I can. I am not interested in a utilitarian argument for or against government and society. That does not get to the question Am I subject to a social contract against my consent? I feel that any form of free rider problem is a utilitarian argument and I will evaluate it as such unless an argument is made why I shouldnt evaluate it in that way. I think the best way to approach this subject for me is to make the argument that ST social contract theory is true and is not mutually exclusive with complete consent. That was the first plank or why I think ST is false. The second plank is that ST advocates have their own agendas to enforce their own worldview on society. I dont have a formulated argument for this because I think this is selfevident due to the fact that every ST advocate has an affirmative worldview and think that society should be run in adherence with it. hange my view. . God created man. This doesnt have the be God of the Bible or even the God of a theistic religion. To my knowledge most western religions hold this to be true. . Because God is totally free so are humans. I want to qualify this. No one is free to harm another person. If people were free to harm other people then no one would be free. . Since these rights were given to people by God people can not take these rights away. People can surrender various rights as that is a right. Thats my approach. The implication is that I believe in the nonaggression principle. That is no one can initiate physical aggression against another or his property. It is legitimate to everything else. This is why Im not interested in utilitarianism I dont disbelieve in social contract for any consequentialist reason. Even if it is more practical for a society to be governed by social contract that would not change my view that such governance is a violation of the natural law. I would read and respond to a utilitarian argument but I doubt that would change my mind as utilitarianism isnt the primary reason I believe as I do. y purpose of writing that was to streamline the discussion toward points that I find more persuasive to me.',\n 'Ive been doing this for years.

So once again thank you ',\n 'It is perfectly legal and normal for cops attorneys etc. who are trying to get information from a subject to lie to them in an attempt to get information from them. Here are the reasons Im against it Often times if a subject is in custody their only source of information about whats going on is their lawyer and those interrogating them. It can be extremely difficult to deduce the truth for a suspect. Often times police officers lie to try and get the suspect to give up information or confess in hopes of lessening punishment or explaining their side of the story. y argument is that such lies also encourage the suspect to confess even if they didnt do it to try and lessen the punishment. It also fosters an attitude among the public of dont trust a cop because you know they can and will lie if they think itll help their case whether its true or not. In regard to exceptions Im okay with the police lying in two situations. First if they are currently undercover in an investigation. It is obviously impossible to conduct such investigations otherwise. Second I would say lying is okay if they have reason to suspect someones life is at risk such as if a kidnapper has someone tied up somewhere and you need to rescue them. !

A lot of us dont agree with defense spending myself included. A lot of this War on Terror has just proven to be an inconvenience for ordinary citizens just look at the TSA and what we have to deal with to get on board a plane. Others are blatant violations of privacy such as NSA surveillance. Some people disagree with how universal healthcare should be run and wouldnt support it with their hardearned dollars. But if a similar number of people dont support sending our troops abroad to fight wars that almost nobody has an interest in. To be clear I strongly support implementation of healthcare as it is executed in the Nordic countries and I advocate the Nordic model in general. Im not saying only socialist countries should have militaries but I do say that the implementation of national armed forces and healthcare are too similar from a purely economic perspective to support one and oppose the other.

Im not convinced that rape culture exists in a significant way and I certainly dont believe that society is cultured to excuse rapists. To clarify I believe that rape culture hardly exists not that it doesnt exist at all. First of all sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments. It seems that society as a whole shares a strong contempt for rapists. Also when people offer advice regarding ways to avoid rape the rapist is still held culpable. Let me use an analogy a person is on a bus and loses hisher phone to a pickpocket. People give the person advice on how to avoid being stolen from again. Does this mean that the thief is being excused or that the crime is being trivialized? Probably not. Ive noticed that often when people are robbed from or are victims of other crimes people tell them how they could have avoided it or how they could avoid a similar occurrence in the future. In fact when I lost my cell phone to a thief a few years ago my entire family nagged me about how I should have kept it in a better pocket. Of course rape are thievery are different. I completely acknowledge this. However wheres the line between helpful advice and rape culture?. I think that some feminists confuse these two placing both of them in the realm of rape culture. Personally I do not think that victims of any serious mentally traumatizing crime should be given a lecture on how they could have avoided their plight. This is distasteful especially after the fact even if it is well meaning. However I do not think that these warnings are a result of rape culture. ! ',\n 'I think its likely that primitive societies that allowed women to have an equal or dominating say in political matters were probably out competed by patriarchal societies. In this sense patriarchy may be a natural tradition. This does not imply that patriarchy is good or justified though. The reason I think patriarchies outperformed matriarchies is that primitive societies were in no position to compensate for the potential distortions in judgement caused by the menstrual cycle of women. PS in particular has unpredictable psychological consequences for women. On the average it seems likely that men would be more consistent decision makers than women. Although men do not have better judgement than women do on average a man of good judgement is more likely to be consistent than a woman of good judgement due to the psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on the woman. And to reiterate I am aiming at an explanation for patriarchy with reference to the efficient cause not at a justification for patriarchy. To clarify what I mean by primitive I mean primitive with special emphasis on the sophistication of the societys psychological science. Societies that can measure predict or otherwise compensate for the psychological effects of menstruation may not have any use for the nofemaleleaders heuristic. Therefore the advance of psychology as science has potentially made patriarchy obsolete. Im not understanding the reasoning behind men are stronger therefore patriarchy yet. Surely there is more to leadership than being physically strong. Im sure Napoleon wasnt the the strongest bloke in the French army was he? If physically weaker men can become leaders why would physically weaker women have a problem? ',\n 'For a long time I followed Ron Pauls reasoning on the war in Iraq that we were doing more harm than good and that bringing our troops home would reduce threats of terrorism and save us money in the long run. So we did that ISIS formed and terror threats are much greater than they were before. I still follow Ron Paul and his message has not changed whatsoever despite his assertion that leaving Iraq would be better for everyone. I think that the biggest mistake Ron Paul and libertarians in general made was assuming that leaving the middleeast would cause extremists to forgive us. The reason they hate us so much is not because we were over there but because we support Israel their number enemy. The libertarian answer to that is to simply stop funding and supporting Israel but I dont think that is a good idea especially on a moral level. People argue Israel is strong enough to defend itself but that is only because of all the military support we give them. Without us they would be overrun by the bordering Islamic nations that routinely vow to wipe them out. So we are basically stuck defending Israel which means we have to defend ourselves from attack. Simply leaving the area didnt stop extremists it only made them regroup and strengthen.

In my opinion people today are focusing on the wrong things and fail to take into account what it means to be a police officer. When both of those occur together you end up with a populace that hates and fears the police rather than trusting and respecting them. Police officers have a duty to combat and possibly prevent crime. It is literally a part of their titleon any given day police across the nation will directly encounter every aspect of any given societys criminal elements from petty speeding violators up through massmurderers. Thats their job. Any given encounter must be treated as a potential worst case scenario if the officer wants to maximize his chance at survival. Granted most encounters are NOT worst case scenarios but that only magnifies the fear for cops. Its like winning the asshole lotteryi.e. is today and in particular this one stop the day that you win the asshole lottery and have to use lethal force in order to survive? Is today the day that you could die because you didnt respond accordingly? Normal human beings have a survival instinct. Assuming that police officers are normal human beings they must also possess the same desire to protect their own lives when they make an arrest of any sort. Thus they will judge encounters based on prior policing knowledge in order to gauge threats and will react accordingly to protect their own lives. Now Im not arguing that police can and do abuse power. But I A arguing that a combination of both media saturation and cultural misunderstandings skew public opinion away from police legitimacy and authority. Furthermore I think that people today would have a greater appreciation for police if they A Understood a cops daily life and B Understood how to act when a police officer detains you for any reasonbe it traffic or otherwise. TLDRIf people knew what it was like to be a cop and as an extension how they should act when a police officer confronts them they would be less likely to act belligerently and they would also be less likely to suffer harm as a result. .',\n 'I dont want to toss out dozens of anecdotes here but I THINK the general consensus with Americans is that people generally felt ORE comfortable interacting with police in the past than they do today.

Its like winning the asshole lotteryi.e. is today and in particular this one stop the day that you win the asshole lottery and have to use lethal force in order to survive? Is today the day that you could die because you didnt respond accordingly? Normal human beings have a survival instinct. Assuming that police officers are normal human beings they must also possess the same desire to protect their own lives when they make an arrest of any sort. Thus they will judge encounters based on prior policing knowledge in order to gauge threats and will react accordingly to protect their own lives. Now Im not arguing that police can and do abuse power. But I A arguing that a combination of both media saturation and cultural misunderstandings skew public opinion away from police legitimacy and authority. Furthermore I think that people today would have a greater appreciation for police if they A Understood a cops daily life and B Understood how to act when a police officer detains you for any reasonbe it traffic or otherwise. TLDRIf people knew what it was like to be a cop and as an extension how they should act when a police officer confronts them they would be less likely to act belligerently and they would also be less likely to suffer harm as a result. .',\n 'I dont want to toss out dozens of anecdotes here but I THINK the general consensus with Americans is that people generally felt ORE comfortable interacting with police in the past than they do today. In my opinion people today are focusing on the wrong things and fail to take into account what it means to be a police officer. When both of those occur together you end up with a populace that hates and fears the police rather than trusting and respecting them.

But this high risk low probability scenarios warrants some attempt at planning and investment. The U.S NATO whoever would be willing to participate should implement and agency with funding comparable to NASA whos sole purpose is to plan for hostile alien threats. The NATO and the Soviet Union spent years planning how to nuke each other into the stone age and how to fight each other after that its not that big of a conceptual or technological leap to do something similar when facing an alien threat. It could include A stockpile of nuclear tipped Delta Is that could hit targets before they reach earth orbit. A continually evolving observation system that can detect objects across the solar system. A plan for resisting an almost inevitable occupation that would includedispersing weapons and special forces units maintaining a global communications network etc. It may seem crazy now but if we were to face an alien invasion our first response as a species would be to fire off all the nukes and head for our bomb shelters shouldnt we make plans ahead of time that would allows us to do that more efficiently? I dont think we should rely on Jeff Goldblum Swine Flu or an alien gluten allergy to save us. ',\n 'Sure an alien invasion is unlikely and we would be outgunned in most scenarios.

A lot of people think this is strange and have tried to convince me to start. But none of them have ever given me a good reason. None of their descriptions of drunkeness sound remotely pleasant and the potential consequences of blacking out sound terrifying. I do acknowledge that there may be some evidence that small amounts of alcohol can have health benefits. I might at some point decide to drink a carefully measured quantity for medicinal purposes but this post is about drinking recreationally. The only disadvantage to not drinking I see is that I am out of place at many social events that revolve around alcohol. Although I am an extremely introverted person and do not feel a strong desire to attend these events I suppose I might be missing out on some potential friendships or networking opportunities. However I feel that as I get older the prevalence of drinking culture in my peer group will likely decrease. ',\n 'Im in my late s. I have never drank alcohol.

Sites are now giving guilt trip messages about adblock plus and other adblockers which I also find rageinducing.... I get that companies need money to help keep the place afloat but I refuse to click on an advertisement and as a result my computers has been virus free for over years. Another reason I do not click ads is because if I want to go buy something Ill go buy it. Your advertisement isnt going to convince me to neither click on it nor buy your product ESPEIALLY if its one of those annoying scroll ads that you see on mobile.... no matter where you scroll the ad follows and theres a button to get rid of it if you click in the exact right spot.

Things like buying alcohol or tobacco applying for a job getting stopped by police all require photo ID. Yes in theory you could use a birth certificate or social security card as these are forms of ID but if the argument is that minorities or illegal immigrants are discriminated against then these things likely to be just as difficult. Since an ID is necessary in such events why shouldnt it be necessary in others? And if it shouldnt why is it necessary at all? When not skewed by an agenda requiring voters to identify themselves serves to protect the integrity of the election process. ',\n 'Every time I see a fire alarm go off it seems like people act exactly the wrong way and I can only think that its because fire drills are so common compared to real fires that the default assumption is that its a false alarm. When Im in class at university and a fire alarm goes off which is usually a couple of times a semester no one takes it seriously. The professor finishes their last thought while everyone takes the time to neatly pack all of their stuff before exiting the building often using the main exit instead of the nearest emergency exit. Similarly at my dorm last year they would run unannounced fire drills as often as once a month it was so common and the odds of fire so low that generally people just assumed correctly that it wasnt real and sometimes didnt even leave their rooms. Back in high school there were fire drill quotas so if the school hadnt done any for a while they would end up having like three in one week although in fairness in high school the teacher and administration made sure everyone followed procedure so if there was a real fire it would not be a problem in this case but I still feel like it helps condition people to the fact that fire alarms are false alarms. Finally about a month ago I was at the mall and the fire alarm starts going off but no one reacted everyone just went about their business as usual. With these examples in mind it just doesnt seem like anyone takes fire alarms seriously and I think people following any of these practices during a real fire would be disastrous. I recognize that knowing what to do during a fire is crucial and acknowledge that occasional drills are necessary but I think that unannounced drills are counter productive. If drills were always known about ahead of time then at least people would know an unannounced drill was something to take seriously. Also I think that drills are way too common at least in schools and universities in other places they seem far less common in comparison to real fires to the point that a fire alarm in a large public place has a chance of being false. I also realize that in the event of a real fire not panicking and creating chaos is probably more important than reacting as quickly as humanly possible but I still feel like the opposite reaction is pretty bad too. The only way I see people treating a fire alarm seriously is if they can physically see fire but in that case I think all of the training against panicking will go out the window anyways. After all experience under nonlife threatening drill situations hardly emulate life or death situations. I realize that all of the examples I gave were anecdotal but it seems consistent enough over dozens of experiences that I think I can use them in an informal argument such as this. ',\n 'I believe the modern Libertarian as defined by people like Ron Paul is hypocritical when they dont support the ivil Rights Act. I believe theyve selectively refused to recognize particular rights for arbitrary reasons Its not in the onstitution! or for ulterior motives. The modern American Libertarian ascribes to particular rights . The right to privacy . The right of free speech . The right to property . The right to a fair trial odern American liberals add a couple more rights ie from the UNs Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The right to an education . The right to life . The right to equal protection against discrimination any Libertarians however deny that equal protection against discrimination should be a Right. The modern Libertarian doesnt believe in protected classes that you shouldnt be discriminated against for your sex race and religion in terms of business transactions. Libertarians publicly acknowledge that racism is a bad thing... yet go ahead and declare that anybody should be allowed to actively practice racism in business and in personal life. I think thats hypocrisy. If you believe something is bad you should outlaw it. I believe stealing is wrong... thats why everyone has a right to property ownership and a fair trial. Thats why the Right to Property exists to make the world a more fair place and to promote a good where people should profit from the fruits of their labor. The Right to Property and the Right to Equal Protection are very similar in many ways. Both demand a change in behavior of people. In nature you are allowed to thieve and steal however you want. The Right to Property protects people from thieves. The Right to Property restricts your freedom to take anything you want. In nature you are allowed to discriminate and be an asshole however you want. The Right to be protected from discrimination protects minorities from private persecution. It protects people from being hassled and from being denied services for no reason other than stupid ones such as the color of their skin. any modern Libertarians dont stand up for ivil Rights because they dont have the moral integrity to stand up for what is Right. Thats why they deny everyone else common sense positive rights such as the right to life and thus access to things like healthcare the right to education etc. They dont have the integrity to say that these things are good things that should be promoted by society. They instead give some bullshit about how the State has no right to interfere with our lives even in positive ways! Yet at the same time they fully accept the States intervention on matters concerning property or their own privacy. Why do people get to enjoy the states protection in matters of property but suddenly when it comes to ivil Rights state protection is suddenly out of bounds???? TLDR I believe when Libertarians say that freedom from discrimination is wonderful but its wrong to force people to behave a certain way! is a copout. Its hypocritical to deny a Right because it requires government coercion when all Rights require government coercion to enforce. The state coerces you into returning stolen property it coerces you into attending your trial it coerces you to stay out of your neighbors backyard. Theres nothing wrong with government also coercing you into fairly trading with people rather than refusing them service solely because of racism or sexism.

Not only would this make becoming a citizen more fair it would make citizenship a right of passage not just an accident of birth. It would make citizens more engaged and associated with the state if they are required to have a measurable level of knowledge about it.

AfricanBritish is something thats unheard of and I feel that the common practice of labelling certain races as a part of a group of minorities in the US rather than labelling them by their nationality is in fact encouraging social inequality in a subtle way. When you refer to a large of people entirely based on their race and they themselves do as well it may not seem wrong. Particularly when they are given equal opportunities and equal rights as the rest of the population. However I argue that since their identity has been linked to their race nonetheless it in fact encourages an image of separation. When you introduce yourself you dont say Im a aucasianAmerican. Yet it is normal for other races to introduce themselves as Im AfricanAmerican or Im AsianAmerican when we should all be saying Im American. Because then if all races are indistinguishable from each other and are known by their nationality then no subtle separation of identity happens and we can say we have realised equality on a small social scale as well as the large fundamental scale that weve achieved in recent decades. When I talk to a minority I dont identify the colour of their skin as an important thing to take notice of when I later explain him or her to a friend. Theyre just a man or a woman. Its not complete social equality if youre referring to someone and including their race in the explanation or they introduce themselves using their race as part of their identity when not all races engage in this.

I understand that most feminists want equal rights in regards of both sexes but i cant sign off on a ideology that by definition focuses solely on women. To put it in context a bit i believe that most not all of the life lessons of hristianity such as being a good person and not killing but im not a christian. I believe that men and women should have equal rights but im not a feminist Id like the rights for both of the sexes were advocated and not simply womens. The only argument I hear when I mention my views on this is that feminism has evolved into what I would like in a equal rights movement. But by definition its the advocacy of womens rights I dont want to call myself a feminist when the name doesnt reflect my opinions. ',\n 'So currently a lot of government benefits in the US are given as in kind transfers where the government gives you a voucher to buy a specific sort of thing. In particular food stamps give people a debit card with which they can buy nonprepared food from grocery stores and other food retailers. I think the restriction on what can be bought with these benefits should be repealed and that the recipients should decide for themselves what they want to buy. The restriction on buying only food is paternalistic and reduces the range of options available to poor families. hanging the benefit to a cash transfer will improve the welfare of poor families while saving the government money on their administration of the program. The rules requiring purchasing only food seem designed around ideas that poor people are irresponsible and prone to bad decision making and that the government knows better than them what they need. While some people would make worse decisions with the money it does not seem fair to greatly reduce the value of these benefits for the large majority of recipients who are conscientious people in extremely difficult circumstances. But these programs became the way they are for a reason so maybe Im missing something. hange my view. So far uiserane has gotten furthest along in altering my view though not fully there yet. But I need to get some sleep here so will respond to more posts in the morning. ',\n 'No I dont think that all people diagnosed with depression should just deal with it. I understand that depression can be a terrible thing that negatively affects your life in a number of untold ways. I also acknowledge that antidepressants can be an effective treatment. However I think that there are too few standards from separating depression caused by imbalances in brainchemistry and depression stemming from realworld stressors such as personal finance relationships career futures politics and much more. Here are the top three arguments I hear against my position and why I dont agree Imagine that you are k in studentcredit debt. Despite having a bachelors degree you make k annually see nearly a third of that money eaten up with taxes and nearly half of whats left gets spent on rent which is increasing annually. In the end you barely have enough to make your minimum payments. The cherry on top is that your boss brings home k annually and treats you like a peasant at work albeit when he isnt working from home. Every day you have to think about the future and how your current situation affects you. You have to think about futureyou. Your prospects are bleak some might say depressing. You cant just sleep it off or get over it because its not changing. The only thing you can do is try to earn more money pay your debts find a job that makes you happy etc. But instead you focus on how it makes you feel You determine you cannot eliminate the depression on your own so you get antidepressants. All you are doing is numbing the pain of the real world. You dont have a condition but you are depressed. The difference is that you are depressed for a reason and that depression might be what you need to motivate yourself to fix your problems. The pills just make you accept your fate rather than work for a brighter future. In this context they are complacency pills... No they dont. Its illegal to pay a doctor in exchange for prescribing people medications. Instead pharmaceutical companies do what lobbyist do They send doctors to seminars which is just an excuse to send them somewhere exciting for a week at an allinclusive resort all while bombarding them with marketing for the medicines they manufacture. They dont have take the companys advice buy your crazy if you think they arent influenced by the bribery. Not that it matters Doctors already find it easier to prescribe miracle pills rather than look for less risky treatment options. Though often pills are all the only thing a patient can afford as therapy is too expensive. The feelings of the patients are irrelevant as they are not doctors and they are biased. Some people truly need antidepressants and they shouldnt be denied it. That doesnt mean we shouldnt question the usefulness of these drugs when they are being prescribed more and more often many times as a first choice of treatment. These drugs have severe sideeffects including depression! Why risk screwing someone up worse when they actually can get over it themselves. TlDr The standards for prescribing antidepressants dont take into account whether the depression is chemical or circumstantial. any of the arguments against stricter regulation are appeals to emotion not science. Now we have a lot of people on pills that just numb the pain of the real world which isnt much different than illicit drug abuse minus the high. However clinical depression does exist and some people do need antidepressants to function normally. These people likely make up a minority of those prescribed antidepressants to treat depression. NOTE Yes SSRIs marketed as antidepressants can be prescribed for a variety of other problems including medical problems that have nothing to do with the brain. I am not taking these situations into account only drugs prescribed to treat depression. ',\n 'This issue arose in my previous deafness  which failed to change my views. It should be a simple train of logical thought. People are not allowed to wear earplugs or headphones while driving. The justification for this is that hearing is a fundamental sense necessary to drive. Deaf people by definition cannot hear. Deaf people lacking a fundamental sense necessary to drive should not be allowed to drive. Some more specific risks that deaf drivers pose source Talking with their hands when they should be on the wheel. Trying to lip read a passenger while driving. Not being able to hear emergency vehicles coming. Not being able to call for help if their car breaks down. Not being able to talk to an officer if they are pulled over. Not being able to hear warnings their car is giving them. The sole argument I have seen presented against this is that deaf people are accustomed to not hearing and are better at vision. But people who become deaf later in life are used to hearing so at the very least they should not be allowed to drive. And this same logic could be applied to say that blind people should be allowed to drive or that I always wear headphones while driving should be a valid excuse.

People will eventually disappear they will go their own paths. You will go your own path you will take up a career maybe start a business or undertake scientific research but eventually were going to all die anyway whats the point of that research when were dead? Our children are going to die too one day Whats the use in spending your time working when in the end what your working for your cause will come to an end? I believe that the pursuit of worldly joys such has falling in love working hard maintaining friendships and taking care of yourself is really not worth the hassle as eventually all these things love friends and your job will come to an end and become meaningless. hange my view ',\n 'I think the purpose of a test is to approximate your ability to understand the material that test is over. Given that it is designed properly the grade a child receives on a test should approximately reflect their understanding of the material and the cumulative score of their tests is what produces the final grade. If that is the case then why does it matter if they figured out say trig identities when the test was first given rather than a week later? To give them a grade that is not reflective of what they actually understand at the end of the course is to defeat the purpose of the evaluation itself. Im using test broadly. I think things that are typically called projects are generally speaking a type of test. I dont think that repetitious busywork should ever be factored in to a grade. Also in case it matters Im speaking from the experience of someone who went through the American public education system. I understand that grades also can be used to measure certain personality factors conscientiousness ability to follow instruction adherence to procedural norms which all debatable might be as important as understanding the material. However you could simply give a separate evaluation of these factors instead rolling them all in to one. Its been observed that performance at the university level corresponds better to standardized test scores than to high school GPA so it is helpful to have a grade that isnt a vague amalgamation of different factors. Note I set specific parameters in the title for a reason. I understand that a teacher might not have time to give endless makeup tests but surely they can manage a handful. I excluded college because I think that raises many questions about different obligations and the manner in which people separate based on ability. I think when it comes to k especially at public schools there is more of a strict obligation to be fair and accurate. P.S. This my first or Reddit post for that matter so I apologize in advance if Ive made any missteps in my presentation. ',\n 'TIL how sexist the US dress code policies are. There was a bit of a misunderstanding here. I was under the assumption that the dress codes were equal for the most part they are where Im from and didnt shit on women in the way that they do. I guess its tough to argue a point that is dependent on geography. I still think as long as the dress code is consistent between men and women its fine to be strict with it. I do not agree with the dress codes that are unequal in this aspect. Here she goes Girls are not sexual objects but it is in a mans nature to be attracted to the opposite gender in a sexual way. For most males the more revealing a woman is of her body the more sexual stirrings they begin to experience. Lets say the teacher is a male and a select few females who are years old age of consent where Im from are wearing very skimpy clothing. This does not make them sluts or whores or anything like that but it does distract the male teacher because it is in his nature to be this way. Now all the teacher can think about are these girls and cant keep his mind on the task at hand. The class suffers due to this and it is a loselose situation as the teacher cannot do his job. It is not necessarily the females fault here but it isnt completely the males fault either. If the schools require females and males although females have different triggers to wear decent clothing that smother at least part of this urge then no one suffers because of it. By having a strict dress code you eliminate the risk of having a situation between a male and female when the main goal is to educate not reproduce. ales are genetically wired to spread our seed as much as possible. Sure they are expected and required to control the execution of this urge when the other party is not interested but the mere fact that the urge exists is enough to distract them from their goals. Yes the school is taking away the freedom of students choice. But the teachers arent allowed to go up to the student and ask them out ASSUING HERE THAT THEY ARE OF AGE because they must remain professional. Why arent the students required to be professional and dress appropriately? ',\n 'TIL how sexist the US dress code policies are. There was a bit of a misunderstanding here.

I dont see dance as a academic discipline and dont think my school should offer degrees in it of that people should pay Tuition to Study Dance To me when someone says to me Im a dance major would be like someone saying Im a football major. The majority of dance classes at my school are physical conditioning practicing dance. I see no academics in the way the other arts Theater Literature Photography Film ect have academic sides. A BA in Dance is also among the more useless degrees as it qualifies you to do nothing but teach dance. Professional Dancers dont have college degrees in Dance and the Dance Students here are throwing away any shot they have of a Professional Dance career by spending of their prime years in school instead of out in the world dancing. Should my school have a Dance Team? Sure we have Soccer Baseball Field Hockey heer leading ect why not dance? Should my school offer for credit classes in dance? Sure we offer for credit Phys. Ed classes and for credit arts classes painting drawing photography ect. But I see no basis for a BA of Dance theres just not enough coursework or anything resembling academics there to justify a Degree Path. So... ',\n 'I love the atrix Trilogy. Personal views on acting ability aside I believe that the premise that the atrix establishes is one that can only be rivaled by a few movies. The way the stories are told bring forth endless possibilities to the true nature of the film. I also believe that a lot of the hate towards the film comes from the inability to follow the overarching idea. I do not want to argue the execution of the film i.e. cast cgi quality light use of cords. I only want to argue the structure and intent of the movie. Sequence of events and dialogue between characters are fair game just not the actors ability to show any emotion saying them. What I am asking is this did the trilogy make philosophical or logical mistakes big enough that destroy the integrity of the film. ',\n 'SPOILERS AHEAD FOR ASTERHEF I recently got into watching asterhef. I was a huge fan of Josh one of the competitors in Season . When he was eliminated Gordon Ramsay promised him work at his restaurants. As I thought that was a nice gesture I looked into whether or not he had ever gotten said job. As it turns out he killed himself about a week after his elimination aired. Jesus hrist. That hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I was just wanting to find out the employment status of this competitor that I liked and I found out that he killed himself! After a little more research I found out that there have actually been two other suicides tied to Gordon Ramsays show. One was a failing New York restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares where Gordon yelled at the owner that if he didnt start improving his restaurant was going to sink to the bottom of the Hudson. After the restaurant failed the owner jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge into the Hudson and died. The second was a female chef on Hells Kitchen who killed herself shortly after her elimination aired. I tried to convince myself that this was bound to happen with the number of people that had been on his shows but even using my most generous statistics three suicides in the past four years of his shows is about x what would be expected from people in that demographic. Now I cant watch it anymore. I cant watch someone breakdown crying and get any sense of schadenfreude from it without feeling absolutely horrible about myself. Normally Id be of the opinion that they knew what they were getting themselves into and therefore not feel all that bad for them but now thats completely gone. ',\n 'It is true what they say its the most wonderful time of the year! hristmas is in my mind the best holiday of all for a million reasons. Whether or not you celebrate hristmas as a hristian holiday or as the commercialized regular American holiday version it is still the best holiday out there. As a atholic hristian I love hristmas because it celebrates the day Jesus was brought to Earth. I love going to church on hristmas Eve night and singing Joy to the World and praising the Lord for sending us our eventual savior. Apart from religion hristmas to me means family and every year I get to spend time with both sides of my family. I see grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles that I normally dont get to see throughout the year. I also get to spend more quality time with my immediate family which is sometimes hard to do with busy schedules. To many people hristmas is about the presents and although that shouldnt be the main point I would never deny the fact that it is fun receiving gifts from people who are close to you and vice versa I enjoy giving people I love gifts and seeing their excitement upon opening them. I love the story behind the commercialized version of hristmas including Santa lause and his reindeers and elves. I especially enjoy watching hristmas movies about Santa and all other hristmas movies in general. It has become a tradition for many families to watch hristmas movies each night leading up to the th. hristmas cookies and hot chocolate are also an essential part of hristmas and I love both making and eating hristmas treats. Any holiday that promotes baked goods is a holiday I support. I dont know anyone who doesnt get into the spirit of hristmas when they hear a hristmas song and I love when radio stations only play hristmas tunes for the holiday. Lastly I love decorating the hristmas tree and the house with lights and ornaments and wreaths. It creates a magical experience going down the streets and seeing everything lit up against the snow. I could go on and on but those are a few of the things I love the most. ',\n 'Every time I see a commercial for the Dove Real Beauty campaign I get rather annoyed an offended. These commercials portray women who are supposed to represent what real beauty is. The eight or nine women featured are of average height and vary in skin tones but are all curvy. None of them are what people would consider skinny or thin. I dont think anyone would label them as athletic or incredibly fit nor would anyone say they are obese. y issue here is that many people have tried to convince the world that no matter what size you are youre beautiful and should love your body. That being said this commercial shows one type of body rather curvy and maybe even verging on slightly overweight. Is real beauty not being thin even though you may happen to have a high metabolism or eat healthy foods? Is real beauty not being athletic or strong or muscular? Are we saying that its okay to have extra fat on your bodies because no matter what size you are youre beautiful? I realize that many people cant help what size they are no matter what they do and Im not saying that being stick thin or anorexic is okay either and I dont agree with modeling agencies that promote models being underweight. What I dont support is companies saying that real beauty is being round and curvy when in actuality that may not be very healthy and shouldnt be settled for. I think women should try and be their best self fit healthy active and strong. I think these women should be praised and promoted. Although everyone should be confident in their own skin and should never dislike who they are I dont think its okay to except being overweight because real women have curves. FYI I am a female and weigh around lbs. I run cross country in college so Im fairly active. ',\n 'Every time I see a commercial for the Dove Real Beauty campaign I get rather annoyed an offended.

',\n 'When my cousin was and I went to her house I was absolutely appalled that she addressed her mother by her first name instead of mom. alling your parents mom or dad isnt just a sign of respect it is sign of love as well. om and Dad are titles that parents have earned by having and raising kids. Parenting is an extremely hard job and parents deserve respect. Another time I was very bothered by someone not calling their parents mom or dad is when my friend was talking about something nice her mom did and addressed her by her first name in the story. Regardless of the setting you should continue to call your parents mom and dad to show your ongoing respect for them whether youre out of the house or out with friends. I also believe that using r and rs when addressing those older than you or authority figures is an absolute must. I also know of people who prefer being addressed by just their first name because the title r or rs makes them feel old. They have insisted that even children as young as call them by their first name. Feeling old is fantastic in my opinion! It is also a natural part of life but it is also something that one should be proud of. It shows that you have lived and you are wiser than I am. It shows your level of knowledge is far beyond mine and that you deserve respect from me. Furthermore this also creates a problem later in life when children make calling adults and respected figures with higher statuses than them a habit. It is so disrespectful and hurts those who have earned these titles that demand respect. NOTE I am addressing the matter of people who prefer to have titles before their names and children who repeatedly forget to use the title or ignore the title altogether. Also just because I think adults deserve respect for being adults DOES NOT EAN I DO NOT RESPET HILDREN. I love children and hope to dedicate my life to them as a pediatric nurse. I am also so I am writing this from the perspective of a child as opposed to an adult. NOTE y title and thesis for this post was too rigid. If i could rename it I would omit the words never and always. I understand that each individual has different preferences and respect that but I am mainly speaking of people who prefer to be addressed with a title and who arent addressed with that title. I also understand that complicated family situations cannot be applied to the title thing.

I enjoy that high school taught me how to write well and that skill will guide me all throughout my life. However I think it is important for high schools to balance their curriculum with more practical skills than theoretical. I know some basic information on taxes through my government class however I have not a clue how to balance a checkbook or fill out an i form. You may think I am ignorant and I know I shouldnt spend more money than I have but other than that I am seemingly unequipped to tackle the duties and hardships of financial life after University. y school also never taught me protocol if someone chokes or if someone is having a heart attack. Obviously I wont be in situations where someone is having a heart attack everyday but I really think knowing how to save a human life is more important than solving a geometric proof.

Im not debating income inequality.

Please enlighten me and change my view. ',\n 'Im currently a junior mechanical engineering student at a highly competitive university who is just now considering to do premed. Thus with some planning I can get a degree in mechanical engineering aerospace engineering biology and chemistry with a minor in applied math and physics by the end of my senior year. I can do this because I already have a ton of credits and Im currently taking credits this semester and planning for credits next semester. As of last semester my gpa is . and consists of mainly mechanical and aerospace engineering classes no bio or chem classes. So far this semester I have had a few exams and based on how I did on those exams I feel as if my GPA might improve to . or . if I really really study hard at the end of this semester. I am also involved in a bunch of E. activities though no leadership roles I doubt I wouldve had leadership roles this semester anyways regardless of my heavy course load. Although I am extremely busy this semester I still find ways to make time for a small social life. I average about hours of sleep a night during the weekdays and sometimes I will take hour naps Although it may help a lot my primary motivation is not to impress medical schools. I would have still done this even if medical school or other graduate schools were not in the picture. Im doing this because I have an interest in these classes getting a degree gives me a physical goal to work towards and I will get personal satisfaction once I get these degrees because of the insane amount of work I will have put in. Also in order not to seem overqualified for jobs that I will apply to in the future I plan to only list relevant degrees on my resume not just all of them. People have tried talking me out of this but Im still not convinced so !

',\n 'Why should I care if someone else is making more money than I am? Aside from jealousy what reason is there to want to reduce inequality? Sure some people are rich because they work harder and some people are rich because they were in the right place at the right time. We dont always give everyone the same chances but thats not what this question is about. There is a huge distribution of income even among college graduates if weve given them equality of opportunity why should we try to ensure equality of outcome? Even the top paid EOs are paid that much because we live in a capitalist society and thats how much their company is willing to pay them. Thats their market price its achieved through a fair system and legal means. Why should we care if they make a hundred or a thousand times the average worker if the system they got it through was fair? Scandinavians are so proud of their egalitarian principles but all I see is a society that holds down its overachievers. Those who stand out are knocked back down. Why is wanting to tax away your higher earning neighbor considered a good thing as opposed to being happy for someone elses good fortune?',\n 'Okay so I know that this is going to be unpopular but here goes. As the title says I dont see anything wrong with going to a restaurant right before they close and ordering a full meal. If a restaurants policy is to seat people up until closing then I have no problem with it and I will demand the same level of service that I would get in the middle of the day. If a restaurant stops seating an hour or so before closing so that their staff gets out at a certain time then I totally get that but if they close at pm and they choose to seat me at pm then Im going to take as long as I normally would and not rush through dinner. ampnbsp Reason For This iew Last week a group of friends and I were on the way home from a football game and we wanted to get something to eat. So we stopped by a restaurant that closed at pm it was around pm so I went in and asked if they were still open they said yes. They asked how many there would be and I told them . They said No problem so we went in. The servers had an attitude right from the start and as we were sitting down they tried to tell us that only certain things were available because the kitchen was already shut down. I told them that that wasnt okay and that we werent going to order off of a partial menu and if the whole menu wasnt available wed leave. A manager heard me and saw us getting ready to split so she came over and said that the whole menu was available and that we could order whatever we liked. So we did.

I always thought I was in the majority before this. Now I am referring to domestic flights on the economy class of American carriers as I understand that different airlines have many different seating options. Also I am excluding lying down reclining for any medical purpose. The counterpoint that most of these people where using was that they paid for the seat or they were entitled to a nap. But when I fly I pay for a window seat yet Im still expected to close the window for most of the time. Additionally my employer expects me to get work done and pays for wifi. If the person is reclined so far that I cant use an average size laptop arent they in the wrong? Finally passengers have been kicked off for things that endanger the comfort of others before like body odor. If someone is constantly reclining and unreclining on a tall individual isnt that true?

',\n 'Let me outline what too much may be and what sensibly may be. Sensibly The person may have had a lot to drink but you would not be able to tell if the person had been drinking Too much completely free the person is clearly drunk. They perhaps are dancing like theres no tomorrow but theres a danger that they could be sick. Let me ask you how many house parties have you been too where you think that was absolutely brilliant Ill remember that for a long time and everyone was drinking sensibly? ery few I imagine. On the other hand the parties that you most remember best are the ones where someone is doing something unusual and hilarious due to the amount of alcohol they have had. Now I had this conversation with a friend who argued the opposite bringing up the point that the person or people who drink too much may eventually become a burden to the whole party if theyre sick. I however think that they would not be that much of a burden as you can give them some water and leave them alone plus theyve probably spiced the party up with their antics for two hours beforehand. Basically I believe a party where everyone is too drunk is much more desirable than a party where everyone drinks sensibly even if it results in sickness. Side note an argument that references health will not . I am speaking primarily of the population and do not believe that this is acceptable for those that are much older.

In reality though my argument would be just as valid if a couple considered the dad staying home but concluded that we just cant afford for him to stay home. I personally see value in a mom staying home until all the kids are in school. To me I do not see much value for the family in her staying home after that. BUT THIS IS TOTALLY Y OPINION AND IS IRRELEANT TO Y ARGUENT. I dont really care if you think moms andor dads should stay home or not. I only care about why they believe they are not staying home. Here is the core of my argument. any women convince themselves that they really want to stay home with the kids but that their current financial realities over which they have no real control will not allow them to do so. Essentially they are convincing themselves that powers outside of their control are dictating that they must go back to work. I believe that for most families who use this line this is nonsense. There are usually options moving to a smaller houseapartment or a cheaper town cutting expenses going out to eat less cheaper vacations consigned clothes cordcutting etc.. Due to all kinds of cultural pressures of which so many of us are largely unaware many families legitimately feel like they cannot go without cable T cook dinner for themselves each night go on cheaper vacations etc. I know that this post sounds incredibly judgmental. To be transparent if you couldnt guess already my wife is a stayathomemom SAH with our month son. She worked in a great career until our son was born. When she had been home for a few months technically on maternity leave from work people began to ask whenif she would go back. When we said that she would be staying home we were consistently met with the same reaction Oh thats wonderful! I really wish that I could stay home with my X kids but we just cant afford that. Often the dad was making more than me! What? I started to get annoyed. I was not angry because these moms went back to work do whatever you think is right but that they were all giving us really crappy rationales for their decisions. If you want to go back to work so that you can stay in your nice house go to the aribbean every few years and eat at the nice restaurant in town a few times month thats cool just say that. If on the other hand you went back to work because you just felt like you had to and never really considered making the kind of lifestyle i.e. economic changes it would require then thats really sad. Ok reddit change my view! One quick note I have never done one of these before. I tried to be honest and direct with my view given the point of this forum. I recognize that it sounds pretty snobbish and well mean. Please be assured that I never really talk this way when having an actual discussion about this stuff with working of SAH moms. ',\n 'Over the years I have come to notice how I believe as a general rule quality is better than quantity. It is more valuable to have less of something supreme than to try to acquire a greater amount simply for the sake of the number. By following this idea and recognizing the alternatives people will actually feel more appreciative of what they have in scenarios of both tangible and intangible goods. Less is more. For example the clothes consumers buy. In my eyes it is better to spend more money on a few timeless pieces that you will love and wear all the time than to buy a whole collection of cheaper things. It is more than likely the quality pieces will last longer and will end up being the better deal than something that breaks or isnt worn again after one time. If you feel otherwise please change my view! ',\n 'Over the years I have come to notice how I believe as a general rule quality is better than quantity.

',\n 'Im submitting this because Islam is a problem that needs to be dealt with is the post on every controversial opinion thread i.e. its extremely popular at least on Reddit. And a lot of smart people like hristopher Hitchens have said the same thing so I dont want to completely chalk it up to Reddit being Reddit. Anyway I got into this site through ratheism and lurked there for two years before making an account and realizing that there were far more fresh and interesting subs out there. Suffice to say Im not coming at this issue with a we must respect religions even if their adherents do terrible things attitude. Because . . . . I recognize that terrorism as we usually think of it is disproportionately Islambased. . I recognize the phenomenon of people in a firstworld highly developed society suddenly becoming radicalized in the name of Islam and plotting terrorist activity or travelling to join alQaeda or ISIS. But as I see it this can all simply be explained by the fact that the part of the world that is most predominately Islamic the iddle East has been fucked with throughout the second half of the th century. Political social and economic disorder breed radicalism see postWWI Germany which found a convenient home in Islam. If Islam hadnt been there or is removed in the future I think radicalism would just manifest itself in the next big thing nationalism racism politics etc.. Up until the midth century Islam was widely regarded as one of the most peaceful and tolerant religions out there. And if the iddle East were traditionally a hristiandominated area and the West traditionally uslim there would probably be people right now beheading journalists in the name of Jesus. As for satellite terrorists in firstworld countries I see it as an inevitability like the Americans who became Nazisympathizers during WWII. If an ideology is powerful enough it might lure in a small number of idiots elsewhere. Its bad but its not unique to radical Islamtheres no hypnotizing verse in the Koran that turns people into terrorists. Im not making a defense for religionobviously it can be a vehicle for hatebut in this case I think its just the most convenient vehicle in a long line of them. So if you could wave a magic wand and Islam would disappear something else would rise up to take its place. What do you think? I dont really want to dislike Islam but I sometimes feel like Im being overly tolerant if thats possible.',\n 'Being the college freshmen that I am I have very recent experience with the financial side to college. I have noticed it is very hard for upper middle class students to find ways to fund college. Schools give out little grants to them and the government gives out even less. This however is justified in my opinion. There is only so much to give out. On the other hand I found private scholarships to be the most frustrating. Every single one that I applied for was based on financial need. y academic and philanthropic resume didnt matter. All that was looked at was how much my parents made. I am not suggesting that I should attend college for free. I shouldnt. However there should be more ways for middle class students to help aid them. any times poorer students get money from the school and government and then from private scholarships. I believe there should be better ways for middle class students to find scholarship money to help them pay for college. ',\n 'I regularly eat out in restaurants and usually get good food and good service. I typically tip well or more as I grew up in Las egas where tipping is the cultural norm. I do not however complain about food or poor service unless I am on my way out the door and then I am very unlikely to return to that restaurant ever again. I have the following reasons . I believe that servers have established an atmosphere of fear as an industry and promote the beliefs that tips are owed for all service and that they can very easily retaliate against customers by tampering with their food. . I believe that most restaurants know what the quality of their food is and have already taken the quality control steps that they wish to take. They are extremely unlikely to change their quality based on rare customer feedback. . I believe that customers who complain are seen in a bad light regardless of how they phrase their criticism. The only hope that a customer has for having a good experience is to sit down shut up and hope that the restaurant provides a good meal and decent service. I believe there is only one safe course of action for poor service or food A. Stop eating anything that is offensive call the server and manager and point out the problem. Refuse a replacement and refuse to pay for the bad portion. B. If bad service find the manager and pay them directly with no tip. Explain the issue but pay your bill. . Tell friends write bad online reviews and help others to avoid the establishment. D. Never return. hange my view so I can return to places that just made a mistake. ',\n 'I believe this generation much too quickly moves on once things dont turn out like they wanted it to when it gets hard almost impossible. I believe that if there is a special someone who for some reason wont get out of your mind even though years pass then theres a reason for it and you should fight for what you love even if it takes you years decades and even if you never actually win her over. Imagine what Dante wouldve done if he had gotten over Beatrice? Or Kafka had forgotten ilena? I believe we should all believe in love and fight for it.

',\n 'orporate Personhood is a legal concept where corporations have the same rights as people under the th amendment. This part of the th amendment was written with the emancipation of slaves in mind after the civil war. I think the he word person in this part of the th amendment has been warped and skewed in order to give corporations power power that frankly I do not think corporations need or should have. I think that the concept of orporate Personhood is not beneficial to the people of the United States as a whole. In my view the words of the constitution should not so easily be interpreted and reinterpreted to fit the needs of a few. Heres a quick video  That being said I am absolutely open to having my opinion changed BUT I wont do so lightly! So What do you got?! ',\n 'On reddit and other sites I continually hear people say with absolute confidence that atheism is not a belief in no God but a lack of belief and so people who criticize atheism or state that it is a kind of faith just as much as theism are wrong. The justification for this is usually the argument that the prefix a means not so atheism must mean not theist. I believe this is mistaken. First the dictionary definition Definition of atheism the belief that there is no God. disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings. Read ore  These are clearly binary statements showing hard stances of beliefdisbelief not a lack of belief. Note that these are the only two definitions on dictionary.com. Websters dictionary is much the same using disbelief and doctrine to describe atheism. ompare this with agnostic Definition of agnostic person who believes that the existence of God is unknown and unknowable or that human knowledge is limited to experience. Read ore  This is a lack of belief. The synonym study clarifies that an agnostic refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine while an atheist has a doctrine that there is no God. Now some people claim that there is such thing as Gnostic and agnostic atheism. These seem to be very modern labels people use to escape the argument that atheists disbelieve in God by saying they are agnostic atheists. Now these terms dont seem to be recognized by any major dictionary but from their usage it seems to mean that a Gnostic atheist faithfully states that there is no God with a sense of certainty while an agnostic atheist says that there is no God but we dont have proof? Ive yet to have someone really clarify this in a way that makes sense to me. Heres the thing if you state that there is definitely no God on your faith alone that isnt Gnostic atheism that is just atheism! If you say we dont have proof but there is probably no God that falls within agnosticism. If you say there is no proof but there is definitely no God yet this somehow isnt a decision of faith i dont think there is a particular word for that because you are talking out of your in a sense there. So maybe agnostic atheism is the word to use here but it is a corruption of both words in this case. Some anticipated counterpoints We should let people label themselves as whatever they want. No because this confuses the argument and not only makes it difficult to understand what the other person is trying to say and to state things clearly yourself it allows dishonest commentators to constantly say no you havent proven me wrong because Im really this ad nauseum. The current definitions are too broad. We can easily narrow them down by saying I am an agnostic who believes our existing knowledge makes God almost impossible but we dont have the evidence to prove the theory of God wrong instead of misusing words which already have a definition and causing confusion. Agnostics have no doctrine so they cant say that there isisnt a God which means there needs to be a word between I just dont know and atheism. I think this is the strongest argument as doctrine means principle or belief and isnt necessarily limited to a yesno binary dynamic. Still it seems much clearer and more logical to say Im agnostic but there is probably no god than to say Im an agnostic atheist so there is no god but there is also no proof but this isnt a matter of faith. Agnostic atheism seems hypocritical to me. Also see the Socratic definition below. Also those people who do identify and use these words properly shouldnt be forced to relabel themselves simply because internet goers got it wrong. Its also unclear whether most people get the word wrong or if its just the reddit community and a few other forums. Id love to see information based on academic texts or politicalnews discussions. ..... I truly welcome anyone to correct my definitions of Gnostic and agnostic atheism. As I said i couldnt find official definitions and Ive only heard the terms used online so Im basing their definitions on that context and my own limited analysis. Otherwise change my views here that atheism is a hard beliefdisbelief and agnosticism is the soft version and that gnosticagnostic atheism is a misappropriation of these words to create definitions which already exist as other words and that this is harmful to clear honest discussion of the topic. At the moment Im getting mostly down votes for a post I put a lot of thought into and have commented on every response to. Are you down voting because you disagree with me or because you think Im unwilling to change my view? Also no one has so far addressed anything beyond what is the correct definition of these words today. The point that the original definition of atheist was binary has not been challenged nor has the idea that binary is clearer. Some people have said that the definitions used on ratheism are the ones real atheists use but have given very little evidence of this. Im open to that idea but since the dictionary which reflects real language use all academics Ive spoken to and nearly every atheist Ive met in person all use the classic definition I havent been given any reason to think it extends beyond reddit and the writings of Richard Dawkins. I argue back hard and ask you to give me evidence but provide that and Ill happily change my view. I do acknowledge that of the major English dictionaries Oxford does include lack of belief as part of its definition of atheism for the US and Britain but that is also inconsistent with its definition of agnosticism in its US English section. It seems Dawkins and other modern writers may have had a pronounced effect on the current definition in the British entries in the Oxford dictionary. The other major dictionaries do not seem to include lack of belief only disbelief. y view is also changed in that several important groups and a significant number though not all of individuals define themselves by the inclusive definition of atheism which is a spectrum not binary. This type of usage really does change the definition of the word even if it makes it less clear. onclusion atheism should be officially updated to be inclusive based on widespread use and self identification with the term in discussion it is best to clarify how youre using the word from the start or avoid using such charged language I still believe the inclusive definition is unclear and technically incorrect but those drawbacks are outweighed by colloquial understanding and selfidentification in most contexts. Bonus Im still going to call myself agnostic but you can call me atheist if you feel like it.

We can easily narrow them down by saying I am an agnostic who believes our existing knowledge makes God almost impossible but we dont have the evidence to prove the theory of God wrong instead of misusing words which already have a definition and causing confusion. Agnostics have no doctrine so they cant say that there isisnt a God which means there needs to be a word between I just dont know and atheism. I think this is the strongest argument as doctrine means principle or belief and isnt necessarily limited to a yesno binary dynamic. Still it seems much clearer and more logical to say Im agnostic but there is probably no god than to say Im an agnostic atheist so there is no god but there is also no proof but this isnt a matter of faith. Agnostic atheism seems hypocritical to me. Also see the Socratic definition below. Also those people who do identify and use these words properly shouldnt be forced to relabel themselves simply because internet goers got it wrong. Its also unclear whether most people get the word wrong or if its just the reddit community and a few other forums. Id love to see information based on academic texts or politicalnews discussions. ..... I truly welcome anyone to correct my definitions of Gnostic and agnostic atheism. As I said i couldnt find official definitions and Ive only heard the terms used online so Im basing their definitions on that context and my own limited analysis. Otherwise change my views here that atheism is a hard beliefdisbelief and agnosticism is the soft version and that gnosticagnostic atheism is a misappropriation of these words to create definitions which already exist as other words and that this is harmful to clear honest discussion of the topic. At the moment Im getting mostly down votes for a post I put a lot of thought into and have commented on every response to. Are you down voting because you disagree with me or because you think Im unwilling to change my view? Also no one has so far addressed anything beyond what is the correct definition of these words today. The point that the original definition of atheist was binary has not been challenged nor has the idea that binary is clearer. Some people have said that the definitions used on ratheism are the ones real atheists use but have given very little evidence of this. Im open to that idea but since the dictionary which reflects real language use all academics Ive spoken to and nearly every atheist Ive met in person all use the classic definition I havent been given any reason to think it extends beyond reddit and the writings of Richard Dawkins. I argue back hard and ask you to give me evidence but provide that and Ill happily change my view. I do acknowledge that of the major English dictionaries Oxford does include lack of belief as part of its definition of atheism for the US and Britain but that is also inconsistent with its definition of agnosticism in its US English section. It seems Dawkins and other modern writers may have had a pronounced effect on the current definition in the British entries in the Oxford dictionary. The other major dictionaries do not seem to include lack of belief only disbelief. y view is also changed in that several important groups and a significant number though not all of individuals define themselves by the inclusive definition of atheism which is a spectrum not binary. This type of usage really does change the definition of the word even if it makes it less clear. onclusion atheism should be officially updated to be inclusive based on widespread use and self identification with the term in discussion it is best to clarify how youre using the word from the start or avoid using such charged language I still believe the inclusive definition is unclear and technically incorrect but those drawbacks are outweighed by colloquial understanding and selfidentification in most contexts. Bonus Im still going to call myself agnostic but you can call me atheist if you feel like it.

If you smoke at a bus stop or train station you force all the other waiting passengers to breathe in your toxins. If you smoke while just walking through a city you force all passersby to breathe in your toxins. If you smoke in any closed room including your own home you force everyone to breathe in your toxins who visits later. Also your toxins will leave the room as soon as a door or window is opened. If you smoke on your balcony you force your toxins on anyone who might be standing on their balcony or whose window might let in the smoke. In summary anywhere you smoke youre being inconsiderate to other people. I cant really think of any situation in which smoking is not inconsiderate. aybe just maybe I might not mind you smoking in Antarctica. The Sahara is not unpopulated enough. The Amazonian rainforest is also not unpopulated enough and on top of that you could start a forest fire and that would be inconsiderate too.

Once dissipated the concentration of toxins is negligible. Its not up to you to make that call for me. I do not want to breathe your toxins and I decide at what concentration I say its fine for me. Smoking is hard to quit. This is true and I have sympathy for smokers who are trapped in their addiction. Anyone wishing to quit smoking has my full moral support and admiration. Show your willingness to quit and I will help you through it. If you are unwilling to even try or you claim that youve tried and given up or you bring up any other lame excuse to continue doing it then you are being inconsiderate. There are lots of other toxins and some of them are in higher concentration than cigarette smoke. This is changing the subject. The subject is cigarette smoke. Just because we already have other toxins doesnt mean we have to add to them. hange my view!

I personally dont care about football soccer football is best football!. anyway three weeks in a row we have had peprallies during school. y favorite classes happen to be right in the two usual times. I dont think That I should have to waste my time listening to people yell about school spirit instead of learning things for my potential career. The scheduling is especially bad since the class that usually gets cut off is a class that requires you to memorize various commands. So I think that pep rallies should be entirely optional.

First of all I have to mention that I am from Germany so I cannot necessarily relate to US standarts. Basicially we get the joy of analyzing poems shortstories novels you name it and are suppossed to find implied meaning within the text. While I agree that it helps build your general way of looking at literature I think the system that it is taught as is inherently flawed If there is no wrong or right answer I feel treated rather unfairly being graded on a more or less binary system. I once wrote a terrible almost comicial essay because I found nothing that was solid and provable with the text and just made up random stuff Straight A. Whats the point of it? I try to wrap my head around the entire concept since about years. I like to think of myself as an openminded person and this is just about the only thing that I simply cannot see the other side of. You could argue that it helps training argumentative skills find a hypothesis find things to support it explain it but I would much rather see that in the context of actual issues and events. You could make the argument that it makes you a more wellrounded person if you are not completely put off by how random and unfair the grading is ruining literature for you on a whole other level. Two people saying vastly different things both being considered right hurts my fundamental understand of the way that rational thinking works. I simply refuse to accept that you can just come and say whatever you damn well please and be praised for it without actual evidence beyond a might be. I get that for many people discussing interpretations is a way of enhancing their reading experience but what does that have to do with my education? Why am I being forced to dig through that? What do they want to teach me? Tolerance to other opinions? No teacher parent or really anyone could give me a statisfying answer since it ALWAYS consisted of just do it we have to do it i like that you think for yourself but we have to move on you will understand later.

However statistically you can prove a man might be more efficient than a woman in a certain job and therefore should earn a higher pay or at least have a higher chance of getting the position.

This card allows you to access dispensaries and to purchase whatever strains you desire in whatever volume you want up to a cap. This is unlike any other system of legitimate medication. In order for arijuanas medical benefits to be taken seriously it should be prescribed much the same way prescription medication is. You should get prescribed specific strains based on their benefits with specific instructions as to how they should be administered and with what technique. Background I use marijuana medically to treat anxiety and lack of appetite. Before I found a method of treatment that worked I was on a course of Ritalin and then a course of Lexapro. While neither of the medications were effective for me the method in which they were prescribed was extremely helpful. I believe the same method of prescription would help to legitimize edical arijuana ',\n 'Even if you have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia statistically youu probably wont get it and even if you dont have that predisposition you can still become schizophrenic. Genetics play a role in your statistical likelihood but considering a genetic predisposition does no actual predetermine anything its still determined by your environment.

Through neuroplasticity a certain environment can create a brain which behaves in a certain way and just like you get better when you practice piano the more you feel a certain emotion the more that process is physically occuring in your brain the more that process is strengthened similar to the physical neurological process of improving your piano skills. ',\n 'Let me make one thing clear at the start this is NOT a comparison of Android vs. iOS. This is a comparison of the hardware of all the flagship phones on the market right now. This post was inspired by this post from the erge and no I dont think there is an ierge bias there. The points that they present are very valid. The iPhone has the most compromisefree experience of any flagship today. It has a great camera great specifications great size good battery and a good software experience. The runner up the oto X is a close contender but it has sacrifices in the camera and the battery. What I would consider the best Android that I have used the Nexus still has questionable battery life. So Id like you guys to prove me wrong or somehow change my view. Again this is exclusively hardware NOT software. Thats a whole nother debate y case is that of all the flagship phones on the market right now That would be oto X LG G HT One One Plus One Samsung Galaxy S Samsung Galaxy Note iPhone iPhone Plus Sony Xperia Z Nokia Lumia and yes the Nexus the iPhone offers the most comprehensive hardware experience. In my opinion it is compromise free. When someone goes to buy an iPhone assuming that they had weighed all of their options and not just gone with the hype they would not be purchasing it in spite of some hardware compromise i.e. battery life screen size camera processor screen quality or another hardware point of comparison.

Its very short but the point Im focusing on here is at . DISLAIER Now Im from Europe and where I live quite a small village we simply dont have and therefore dont know most of these issues at least not to that extend. Infact most of us are white. any muslims especially Turkish but they dont stand out that much either. So it this offends you be considerate and think about being in my shoes with a different society. Browsing through reddit I noticed oftentimes that remarks that immediately sound racist to americans are perceived very neutrally here. We do have foreigners being from Italian descent Im a foreigner in Germany myself but I dont look that much different to Germans. Yet sometimes I get asked if I run a pizzashop just because Im Italian and many Italians actually do have a restaurant or sell ice cream or something like that. That is not considerate to be racist or offensive here. But Im here to hear you out from a US perspective. END OF DISLAIER Anyway I was surprised at some of the examples in the video. I know its the point to show people that theyre being racist while not even realizing it. I get it. But I have a hard time seeing whats wrong about excluding a race in your sexual preference. Now if the argument is that its racist because Im actually making a difference depending on the race then why is it OK to be sexist making a difference on gender? If the argument to that is Well you didnt choose to like women men but you choose to dislike a race then wouldnt we start to ride a socialjusticerollercoaster that would continue on to other minorities traits or features? Not OK to dislike dating Redheads? Not OK to dislike dating elderly people? Not OK to dislike dating handicapped people? Until we get to our final destination that sounds like you just dont wanna date her because shes ugly! Youre discriminating ugly people. aybe you say its racist because such a statement would express that I think all e.g. black people share a common trait while they dont necessarily have to meaning its racist to pigeonhole an entire race. But then again whats the deal with doing so? For all that matters the term asian black hispanic is putting people into drawers already so thats racist already no? Again I hope not to offend anyone. After all I might be just somewhat ignorant because I dont live in a diverse society like the US. aybe Im missing what exactly is the taboo here. aybe its just taboo to say it but its ok to think like that?? I dont know. But doing a little research I also found this asian girl to call herself racist because she refuses to date guys of her own race I just think that IF we call this racist and put the blame here onto people not wanting to date a certain race then we would start blaming people to be discriminating others for every aspect watering our preferences down until we truly like everyone equally. Note my point isnt so much this isnt racist but more the issue that resolves out of blaming people for their sexual preference even if it comes to someone never wanting to date a certain race. So Im genuinely curious this is my first post on rchangemyview and Im open for a new opinion if you could explain me Why should it be called racist to refuse to date a certain race given my arguments above If it is racist why wouldnt we end up blaming people for refusing to date gingers elder or just ugly people? And finally Arent we all entitled to any of our sexual preferences without needing to justify them? ',\n 'Equality is one of a number of concepts referenced regularly in Western political discourse others being freedom fairness and so on but Im increasingly troubled by the pursuit of it in politics. Usually people dismiss this objection as a confusion between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. The former is something I rarely hear supported but is at least unambiguous in its meaning everyone has the same life quality in terms of health wealth education etc. Only people with a view of the world heavily slanted towards nurture believe this is possible and most accept it is beyond the remit of government to achieve it so far as I can tell. But equality of opportunity despite appearing to be meaningful at first glance is actually nonsense or at least as ambiguous as equality. Does this mean starting everyone from a same footing which would involve compensating for background and genetic discrepancies or simply applying the same provision to everyone? I dont view it as within the power of the state to arrange human affairs so that every child can have an equal chance of prospering at school and even if it was possible I think the destruction of freedom and family life it would entail would be deeply wounding. On the other hand spending the same resources on every child seems equally callous squandering talent at the top while potentially not allocating enough to the disadvantaged at the bottom. As for the legal system equality could seemingly apply to equal rules applied universally regardless of background factors class character etc or attempting to compensate for those factors in the name of fairness. I think theres probably elements of both approaches in our legal system which limits equality to a principle of not being spuriously discriminatory on grounds of race sex and so on. I suppose Im more of a basic standards kind of guy believing there should be a minimum amount of education health and housing that the state should endeavour to provide but otherwise citizens should be left to it. That seems to me to be justifiable for reasons of decency rather than equality. .

',\n 'Ive been discussing this with some friends but I thought Id post this here too. Ive honestly yet to hear a sound argument that would convince me that having widespread anonymity over the internet or on video game networks or chatroom comments or message boards is a good thing. Or at least that the good outweighs the bad. I understand some people have social anxiety and that they dont feel comfortable posting as themselves thats a fair point. But I believe the harassment the threats the racism homophobia and just general douchebaggery would be nearly eliminated if there were real names and real consequences for your wordsactions online. Id love to get into a good conversation about this... because I think its a very interesting topic to debate. So please ! ',\n 'Ive been living in rented accommodation since I moved out of home at eighteen. Housing is super expensive where I live London and I dont imagine Ill ever be able to afford to buy my own place. This doesnt bother me. As a renter I have fewer rights but also fewer responsibilities. If the pipes burst I dont have to pay a plumber to fix them. If the house burns down Im not ruined. There is much less paperwork and legal obligations. Im also not tied to one place I can easily move for work to be closer to family or just because Im bored and want to try somewhere new. The two great drawbacks are roommates who can be very hitandmiss and the fact that at the end of a mortgage you have an asset to your name while with renting its money gone forever. But for the majority of my life it wont make a difference either way and at least this way Im not tied into hundreds of thousands of pounds of debt. Its not as though I can take a house with me when I die so itll hardly matter in the end. I thought I might get a good debate on this since reddit skews American and I believe homeowning is a bigger deal in the US. !',\n 'Ive been living in rented accommodation since I moved out of home at eighteen.

The narrative goes that once that starts to happen on a large scale people who are not part of a small privileged minority who own the means of production will see a dramatic and permanent decrease in their quality of life. This view is probably best presented by this fantastic video Humans Need Not Apply To be clear I am not arguing against the idea that robots and computers will someday replace mostall existing jobs. Im arguing against the idea that it will make us less well off and nobody will be able to find a job. I disagree mainly with this views long term conclusions. Eliminating jobs through technology can only result in a society with more wealth for everyone. In my opinion thinking that large scale automation results in a lower standard of living for most people shows an ignorance of economics and a failure to take into account all the effects automation would have in the long run. Here is my reasoning... First lets look at how improved technology benefits an industry and some examples of what thats looked like in the past. Its fairly easy to show that in the near term automating away jobs in one particular industry benefits everyone else while harming the people in that industry. When refrigeration started becoming widespread ice suppliers were soon wiped out while everyone elses quality of life increased dramatically. Yes ice suppliers used to be a thing. Over the past years longshoremen have found themselves less and less needed while everyone else enjoys cheaper and more reliable oversea bulk freight resulting in cheaper... everything really. Also note that there was a lot of political outcry because of both technological improvements. People saw jobs being eliminated and talked about how the new technology will make everyone poorer. They were wrong of course. In the long term the harming of a particular industry ceases to be a problem because the industry gets replaced by new industries with different jobs jobs that result in better lives for people than the old industry ever did. Instead of ice suppliers we have the jobs in other industries that the increase in efficiency of refrigeration allows being able to refrigerate things for much cheaper and for longer caused a boom in a lot of other industries such as farming transportation restauranteuring food and beverage manufacturing etc. Not to mention the people that make and service the freezers that replaced the ice suppliers. In all more jobs were eventually created by refrigeration than refrigeration replaced. And up to this point in human history this is what all technology has done in the long run. Every useful invention so far has made our lives better. ost people who hold the view that future automation will harm most people respond along the lines that its different this time because technology wont replace one industry but nearly every industry. First of all this view generalizes the negatives without generalizing the corresponding positives... namely if nearly every industry is automated away we will see a corresponding increase in quality and quantity of nearly all goods. And the corresponding plummet in prices. If the production of a car from mining of raw materials to assembly to sales is all automated how much will that car cost? A lot less. Secondly and most importantly this view looks at job elimination and assumes its permanent. This is nonsense if history is to be our guide. In the new hypothetical world of abundant dirtcheap quality goods and services most people will find some new way to make a living. Just because we dont know what that way is doesnt mean it wont happen. Note that I dont necessarily think that automation wont hurt some people or make some people poorer. I think that this will happen in the short term and we ought to come up with some support system for this. But in the long term automation can only help. years after that dark time things will be looking different. years after things will be amazing. Though I feel strongly about this subject now I am definitely open to having my view changed. The idea that automation will hurt people in a long term way seems to be pretty widespread but I havent seen any convincing arguments for it that take all the effects of automation into account. ',\n 'Preface I searched for this topic and two s came up but neither really touched on this aspect. People get annoyed or angry at videos that are taken in a vertical format mostly because screens are horizontal. I posit that this doesnt make a difference. As the world moves to more and more mobile formats responsive sites apps more featureful phones saying that videos have to maintain the old ways is borderline curmudgeonly. Its akin to saying that you cant send tweets or use snapchat because I still use email and I cant read your messages with Gmail. A phone is more naturally held in portrait mode and so taking a video that way is going to be more common. If the people consuming this video are also watching on their phones then the people watching on horizontal screens become irrelevant or at best familiar with and therefore accepting of the idea that videos are going to be vertical. ',\n 'General suicide from long lasting mental illness like depression. Ending your own life because of a terminal illness you may have ending your life because you dont feel any purpose in living these all sound like perfectly good reasons to me for some to end their own life. y general belief regarding life is that people who have done no wrong to others and dont harm society should be free to do as they want and therefore they should be free to lead their own lives. If a person capable of consent wants to end their life for whatever reason who are you or I to dictate to them that they cant kill themselves? For anyone who will bring up short term suidials People who are only suicidal for a short time in my experience at least rarley actually go for it. ost of them on some level just want some attention someone who will listen to them and help them. People who are actually willing to do it are another story. I say this as someone who attempted suicide at age via pills so if youre going to tell me Im insensitive or dont understand this topic dont bother replying. ',\n 'I come to to defend and perhaps have my view changed on the following statement Belief in most contemporary religions such as hristianity Islam and Judaism is innately and inevitably harmful completely indefensible and due to these reasons should be made a criminal offense. y opening statements in the of this view are as follows . ontemporary Religions ause Human Rights Abuses All contemporary religions instruct their followers to conduct abuses of human rights as part of their religion. ontemporary hristianity when followed based on exact instructions rather than its spirit that is general guidelines and recurring themes which are presented throughout the Holy Bible instructs its practitioners to kill maim and torture anyone who happens to violate its codes. While truly literal hristians are a rarity even in the most fundamentalist circles largely due to syncretic difficulties with the currently existing laws and not because of a lack of motive to be even more extremist it is extremely common among more fundamentalist hristians to engage in such things as sexualorientation based discrimination child abuse and worse. Other religions such as Islam are just as bad or even worse in this respect. Some would argue that not all hristians are like this but... . If There Is Religion There Will Be Fundamentalists As society begins to leave its spiritual and superstitious roots behind and move on many who are raised in or have found religion leave behind fundamentalism and become more moderate or liberal. This may even extend to the point where the strict moral code of the religion is left behind and instead the religious belief is used for moral support or emotional uplifting. If we could just get all the fundies to follow in their footsteps wed be golden right?... The answer is no. As long as there are hristians even in the loosest sense there will be a few who open up their Bible and read what it has to say. Some of those people will convince their fellow hristians to become more fundamentalist. Others will simply become radicalized by themselves becoming potential lone wolves. In any case the further from Biblical morals their society is the more fault they will see with it and the more anger they will express. This anger could be expressed in highly nonproductive ways a la Eric Rudolph. The only solution to this problem seems to be completely eradicating all traces of offending religions. Now one could argue that this would bring about backlashes definitely from the fundies and likely from the less strict religious and perhaps even nonreligious human rights protectors who so valiantly guard the freedom of ideology they cherish but that is also not a total stop to this because... . Were Already On Our Way Think about how much progress developed countries have made away from religion in the last few decades. We have successfully removed religion from places where it is neither needed nor wanted such as schools in many cases. Of course there are exceptions many classrooms are still religious in nature and there will always be the religious folk who dont partake in such heathenery and instead homeschool their children so they can receive the necessary dose of brainwashing but we have made a ton of progress. Despite the protests of the angry fundies this is not poised to slow down stop or reverse at any point in the remotely foreseeable future. . Does It iolate Freedom Of Expression? Not Really Freedom of Expression like all rights has its limits. The right to speak freely doesnt apply if you knowingly accuse someone of a crime they did not commit. The right to bear arms doesnt apply if you are manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. And similarly people cannot be allowed to hold irrational views which cause damage to society. Think about it like this. A person who believes black people are inferior to white people can go his entire life without ever committing a hate crime. Even though he considers black people his inferior nothing about this views compels him to ever kill steal from or even refuse a job to a black person. His view is irrelevant but it might predispose him to actions which can be dealt with separately. ompare this to hristianity.

Because of this a person who sincerely believes in the Bible is compelled to perform this actions and harm others in doing so. The fundamentalist cannot reconcile these syncretic difficulties and he is forced to obey his religious text over the law of the land because he cannot reconcile his beliefs. .

Obviously neither physics nor philosophy are useful for collecting trivia type knowledge. Also I concede that philosophy has better tools equipped to understand moral truths. However when it comes to understanding and discovering general characteristics belonging to existing things I believe that physics is superior to philosophy. Here are a few reasons why. Philosophy since it is not experimental in nature merely reorganizes knowledge and does not produce any new knowledge. Descriptions in mathematics are less ambiguous more strictly logical and lead to greater insights than descriptions in English or any other language. Ideas in physics are much easier to test. Philosophy has no defense against counterintuitive truths such as objects have a probabilistic rather than a defined set of characteristics. Hence any study of truth within philosophy will be limited by our own imaginations or intuitions. Newtonian mechanics Big Bang quantum mechanics and relativity have done more to revolutionize our understanding of truth than any theory in philosophy. !

',\n 'The main reason I hate expression of religion and mostly organized expression of religion is because of the prejudices it can cause. I believe religion is th main cause of homofobia and a strong factor in other forms of discrimination. Just because religion tells them so people ostracize the things their religion tells them to or even just anyone who disagrees. Yes this might be very blackandwhite viewed but so much discrimination is andor was brought forth out of religion. So much times has it been abused for its power of organizing people crusades wars genocides. One cant think about WWII the strong nationalism back then can easily be considered as a sort of religion in my opinion without the genocide of the jews homosexuals and mentally handicapped or anyone who disagreed with them. Or for example the Islamic State. I know religion has also done good things but to me it seems they dont even come close to weighting out the bad.

If there was a rape or disease then the abortion should take place right away and the punishment for the rapist increased. But lets be honest there arent even close to a majority of rape and birth defect screeners getting abortions. Yes it does happen but the majority are stupid people being careless and swinging by planned parenthood for a Plan B. The lack of responsibility should not result in a life being snuffed out and I believe that should face repercussions. That is what I mean by needless abortions. People who thought pulling out would work or I thought I took my pill today etc. I watched a girl I worked with drink and smoke her way to a miscarriage when she had twins and then have an abortion. That sort of thing needs to land people in jail even more so than regular disregard for developing life. Someone help me change my view the stress is killing me. ',\n 'A few people to consider. Barack ObamaHalf Kenyan Half aucasian. Known socially asBlack. Tiger WoodsBlack Asian Indian aucasian. Known socially asBlack. itt RomneyEuropean and Latino ancestry. Known socially asWhite. George ZimmermanHalf hispanic Half white. Known socially asWhite. Each of these people brings up an interesting side of biracial perceptions. It used to be that any race mixed with caucasian would automatically be cancelled out. Obama is half black half white but people call him black Tiger Woods is an amalgamation of racs and people call him black. However in recent years these social rules seemed to change somewhat with racially charged cases like Zimmerman being referred to as white despite having a darker race of peruvian ancestry from his mothers side. Romney himself does not acknowledge as latino even though George Romney was from exico defaulting to white to appeal to his base. What is the point of all of this? Its that our terminology for classifying people seems to be outdated as more and more biracial people have come into American life and we need to rethink the logic behind it. Some might say that its wrong to label people but identity is important. Obama has written about how he struggled to decide whether he was white or black as a youth a society that could barely understand the idea of mixed race forced him to choose between one side of his ancestry or the other when he should have accepted both. Tiger Woods calls himself ablinasian or ulticultural. which gives a fair homage to all sides of his family. Referring to someone who is biracial by only one of their races ultimately discredits one or more people who played a part in that person being alive. Whether it is done socially or whether it is done voluntarily like with Romney which is still brought by social pressures. I think that this approach of categorization is fundementally wrong and illogical because it ultimately makes a person deny a big part of themselves and their family. Instead of referring to someone of mixed race as one race there should be new terms invented to better suit who they are. Woods approach with ablinasian and other variations such as Eurasian or simply ulticultural being accepted into mainstream culture would be of a great benefit and a welcome addition to the lexicon for a society becoming more and more multicultural by the day.

',\n 'There was a time long ago when atheists were persecuted in North America and Europe but I dont really think its a big deal any more. People just want to cash in on the victim complex nowadays and atheists are the worst for this. I cant think of a single area of society where atheists would face social disadvantage. Also anyone who for whatever reason is persecuted for being atheist is at least partly responsible for their own persecution. No one knows what your religious views are unless you tell them. And anyone who shouts loudly about being an atheist was probably being a dick anyway. ',\n 'I think my long rambling title basically covers it. Im not inherently antimarket or antiexistenceofrichpeople but AFAIK a system like the uban one is the only one that has truly allowed everyone to be middle class or better. I dont mean the system used in uba specifically hereditary dictatorships arent my thing although Im hesitant to say Im in favour of full democracy because people tend to vote in free market quickfixers that end up fucking them over ie Russia in the s but rather a system based on stateowned industry with limited personal property ownership some private commerce and universal free social programs up to post secondary education and all healthcare. Also accusations of hypocrisy wont work to change my view. I live in a wealthy country and although my family is poor I still probably have a higher standard of living than I would under a socialist system. Nevertheless I think it is the morally correct thing to do if not necessarily the pragmatic thing to adopt a socialist system. ',\n 'It seems to me that the heart of human motivation consists in trying to gain good emotions and avoid bad emotions. For example I go to the gym partly because I want the good feeling of working out partly because I want the good feeling of being more attractive and partly because I want the good feelings of potentially finding a partner who finds me attractive. Similarly I do a job to gain money that I can spend on things that I enjoy good feelings and paying bills avoiding the bad feelings of being sued and going to jail. Apart from when one is in the grip of a strong mood like anger which I dont want to discuss because it does not involve EDIT considered actions it seems to me that this is always the case? an anyone change my view by coming up with examples of times when people do things and they dont expect to get a good feeling out of it or avoid a bad feeling?

He said to hurry because they were gonna get away and dispatch said people were coming. Well they werent coming fast enough and when the robbers were leaving the man said that he had a shotgun and was going to stop them. He went outside yelled at the men to stop and when they ran he shot them both dead protecting his neighbors property. He was never prosecuted. I believe that if everyone in the world watched out for their neighborsfellow citizens and everyone knew that everyone was watching out for each other people would be more hesitant to commit a crime against someone else. As a riminal Justice student this story is one of my favorites and I believe that he did the right thing. You can attempt to change my view on either the fact that he did the right thing or on my title point. ',\n 'I would like to here some reasons why it might be possible though. I know its not right to think this but I cant get the awful thought out of my head that a man would be more harsh and critical of the way I look than I would of them or a woman would be of me. This is something I am constantly going over in my head and I wish I didnt have to. Just check my post history and you will see and get a lot more information. To give brief description I lost around pounds and still have more to lose but its left me with some saggy skin that doesnt look like it wants to go away extremely saggy deflated breasts that do not look right now. I have an overall flabby looking appearance. I have very little experience with men so I do not have any in person reactions to the way I look. I can only go by picture reactions in previous threads which are very mixed and not giving me the answers Im looking for. What are some things to consider that could change my mind? How should I know to believe them? ',\n 'I understand that campus rape is a huge problem and that measures must be taken to solve it or at least get as close as we can. Yet somehow some colleges have decided that actually doing something productive about it was too hard and so now they have hearings in which the accused may be denied counsel and other elements of due process because they arent on trial for anything. Because due process is required in order to levy consequences for a crime an example of which is RAPE colleges that have hearings in which the accused can be expelled without due process should be forbidden from doing so. Sometimes there isnt enough warrant to prosecute and in such cases lowering standards of evidence is ridiculous. Please . ',\n 'I feel as if most of high school is directionless read open and exploratory preparatory education for collegelife. However it seems much of it is pointless and is more force fed book curriculum over actual insightful education that helps foster lifelong learning. I understand that some base education is needed to function in society but much of that is in elementary middle school and at the high school level much of it seems exploratory and not all of it is necessary. Overall curriculum seems just to pass tests and get good grades rather than insight curiosity and help make people learners. this is where I think the internet comes in. So much information is available online today that high school seems obsolete. It is so easy to learn new things that actually interest you and explore the purpose of high school. Instead of being fed meaningless information that may or may not be relevant for your life on the internet you can dynamically learn whatever you want and in as much depth as you want. I know high school gives you a good base for further learning but what use is that base if you do not care about it? Why spend the time and energy doing something that is not relevant to you? ',\n 'Ive been a huge fan of a series since I bought the first one with the second being my favorite game of all time. I told my friend that I was going to preorder it and he started going insane about how preordering is bad. I understand the point of it how with preordering a company can announce a game make it look phenominal then release a game thats nothing more than a half assed game of pong or something. I plan on buying it no matter what might as well get the free DL with it. y main thing is if a company is gonna screw gamers like this then theyre gonna screw us over by releasing bad games anyway hyping it up to no end I just say look at the common perpetrators and stop buying their games unless they actually release something amazing.

I just prefer silence. I even find it hard to concentrate if there is music playing. I have friends who like music very much and they force me to listen to it and I have tried almost all kinds of music but I just dont feel it. There is one exception to the rule. If I have associated a piece of music to an emotion for example through a film that I really enjoyed it can bring me back memories from the movie. But if I hadnt seen the movie then the music would do nothing to me.',\n 'These people are definitely victims but in my opinion referring to them as survivors is in many cases overly dramatic. They might be referred to as survivors if their lives legitimately came into jeopardy if they were held at gunpoint if they were severely physically assaulted etc. but most instances of rape unwanted sexual advances isolated to a single instance do not come attached with a serious possibility of death. Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody but I think that survivor suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign a terminal illness a plane crash or something else of the sort. The former is bad but the latter are almost certainly worse. Rape victims calling themselves survivors takes attention away from more serious issues in which death is on the line. Again rape is a very serious issue but not as serious as issues that consistently result in death. ',\n 'Now Im not talking about an actual book Im referring to the analogy that people use to represent how you shouldnt judge a person by their appearance. I believe this is nonsense. Based on what a person is wearing how they present themself their body language and a bit of intellect you can come to a conclusion or estimate on that persons personality. Im not saying you can completely figure out someone based on their appearance but for sure you can get the brief summary of their life how they behave or personality. Some people are easier to read than others but every little tattoo piercing shirt wrinkle hairstyle piece of clothing the list could continue on forever could definitely be interpenetrated to show a little characteristic about a person and who they really are. You can judge a book by its cover. You can judge a person by their appearance.

',\n 'Heterosexual sex work i.e. the buying and selling of sex more or less is unique and unlike almost any other kind of work. en are the overwhelming consumers and women are the overwhelming workers. There are exceptions but they are less than . The buyerconsumersellerproducer relationship is inherently unequal. The buyerconsumer has all the power because he is the one who comes into the transaction with money. It is up to the sellerproducer to perform. The customer is always right. In labor transactions the buyerconsumer is the equivalent of the bossemployer. In ordinary forms of work the sellerproducer can ameliorate his or her powerlessness through achievement. Whether you are the inventor of the iPhone or you moped the floor you used your abilities to achieve something and created value. Accomplishment is one of the core meanings of life that provide fulfillment. In sex work however the focus of the end product is the body itself which is the embodiment of the workers existence and not the result of her achievement yes hard work such as diet and exercise go into shaping the body but they do not create the body. In summary Sex work is inherently sexed with men cast as buyers and women as sellers. Buyers inherently have the power over sellers in economic transactions. The thing being sold by the sex worker is not her achievement but her consent to use her body. Hence sex work is inherently unequal and privileges men while degrading women. ',\n 'I dont understand how sexual orientation is separate from other sexual interests. How is a man being interested in men distinctly different than a man being interested in short women or old people. It seems like gender is just one identifier for attraction but it is magnified to define someones entire orientation. Why isnt there an orientation for someone who is only interested in girls who wear glasses? Everytime I make a comment with this sentiment it gets rigorously downvoted and I am curious as to why.

It helps me get a clear mind and it helps me think. The reason I dont see it as an addiction is because its never required. I can think well on my own but whenever it gets out of hand I just smoke one cigarette and it completely calms me down. I can go without smoking. For some reason Im just not addicted like I see how some others are addicted. Ive also read whyhow smoking is bad for you and none of it seems to scare me. And then I only smoke socially.

The terrorist group which is now referred to in English primarily as either ISIL or ISIS uses Arabic as its primary language so any English language name will be some sort of translation.

AlSham is itself an Arabic term which can be translated as either greater Syria or the Levant the latter of which is why ISIL is also an accurate translation. The problem is that in the English language media radio T newspapers internet journalism ISIS is translated as The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria which is not a particularly good translation and it minimizes the international threat posed by the group. The Levant actually covers a huge swath of the western iddle East including yprus Israel Jordan Lebanon Palestine Syria and parts of Egypt and Turkey. When media use the term ISIS they are effectively saying that the threat of this group is limited to the two countries Iraq and Syria. On the other hand the term ISIL is slightly more accurate and also serves as a warning that this terrorist group poses a far more broadbased threat to the whole region.

By virtue of being surrounded by dough no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition. alzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. As any New Yorker will tell you the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should because its a calzone! alzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design.

Personal pizzas are possible but are rarely seen in the pizza world. Pizza is a group food and most restaurants provide that option. To help meet individual needs slices are offered. However this introduces the problem of waste. If slices remain unsold what remains of a pizza will inevitably be thrown out.

As any New Yorker will tell you the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should because its a calzone! alzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza the more you put on the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution calzones. alzones reduce wast. alzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion. Personal pizzas are possible but are rarely seen in the pizza world. Pizza is a group food and most restaurants provide that option. To help meet individual needs slices are offered. However this introduces the problem of waste. If slices remain unsold what remains of a pizza will inevitably be thrown out. This is wasteful! alzones dont have that problem. alzones are generally made to order for the individual in a size an individual can eat. One calzone for one person. No waste! To me the answer is clear. We should become a calzone nation. Thank you Benn Wyatt for revealing the truth. Presentation. Pizza can be presented visually in ways a calzone cannot. Preparation. Pizza can be cooked in ways that produce an ideal outcome in terms of flavor a way that calzones cannot because the toppings are directly exposed to heat. Pizza is a superior social food as it is more easily shared. Pizza can at least approximate some of the advantages of a calzone by folding a slice in half. alzones have to have more bread relative to the number of toppings this is disputed but if true it is certainly a point in pizzas favor oisture buildup is a problem if you add too many moist toppings into a calzone. This prevents certain combinations in a calzone that can be put on a pizza and is why many times sauces are delivered as a separate item in a ramekin. alzones cool slower and less evenly making it difficult to eat on the spot and meaning that you will get an uneven flavor experience. These are all very good points. I will have to think this over more. If I change my mind I will start deep dishing out deltas.',\n 'The main factors that have led me to this conclusion are The Democratic System in the US ilitary and Foreign Policy and the Healthcare System. There are also a range of smaller reasons discussed at the end. US Democracy The government system in place is not a good example of a democracy study homepage materialsGilens and PageGilens and Page Testing Theories .pdf. These articles   explain the study more concisely. A system where the affluent elite have the greatest impact on decision making is a broken system. This fact leads to a wide range of problems including the ones described below. US ilitary and Foreign Policy The US has carried out a large number of military invasions relative to other developed countries. website In just one of these invasions Iraq War over half a million Iraqi deaths could be attributable to the war study an you imagine the fallout if one other country was responsible for the deaths of half a million American citizens in the US? And this is just one example if arguably the biggest and most controversial. In addition the reasons for the Iraq war are unclear to me Oil? War on terror? Wild goose chase to find and kill Osama Bin Laden??. Healthcare System This study suggests that of bankruptcies in the US are from medical bills. Of that had medical insurance. I dont want to live in a place where you can go bankrupt easily through no fault of your own. The US spends the most amount of money per capita on healthcare in the world and rank quite low in comparison across a range of health metrics like life expectancy infant mortality etc. Dataset Other problems include the education system up there with the most expensive in the world and nowhere near the top in performance wealth inequality video mass shootings and gun crime Australia made changes why cant the US? high levels of incarceration second in the world and incarceration of innocent people short and shocking documentary I know that all countries suffer most if not all of these problems but I believe it is to a much lesser extent and certainly within industrialized countries in similar economic positions to the US. It just seems there is so much wrong with the United States please ! ',\n 'This all started because I cannot find a subreddit to post an article on because every subreddit has rules. I believe this everexpanding trend of subreddits having more and more rules as to what can and cannot be posted has degraded the quality of reddit in general over the years. Ive been on reddit for a long time before there were subreddits longer under a different account. The discussion before subreddits started creating so many rules was so much more vibrant. The opinions were all over the board and this made the discussions that existed really enthralling to read. Now each subreddit has their own defined set of narrow rules and it requires you to be a subreddit expert to find a subreddit where the post you want to make doesnt break any rules. When you do find such a subreddit it is a dead one with to comments per submission and there is no discussion because it is a very narrow viewpoint subreddit. I believe overall content would be much more interesting to read if moderators of subreddits would remove or at least be more lax on the submission guideline rules. The specific post for use as an example in this discussion was an abortion article asking if it is time to rethink what weeks an abortion is allowed because doctors in the UK are saving babies at weeks and younger. y view could also be changed if someone were able to point out to me a subreddit where this kind of post could be made and that subreddit has actual traffic so that an active discussion would actually take place. I tried rnews but it doesnt allow opinions. I thought about rabortions but its mostly dead. I thought about rprochoice but its too onesided. I thought about rpolitics but it says US politics only and Im not even sure if this discussion is politics anyway plus obviously onesided around there. hange my view that reddit would have more vibrant discussions and be a better website if rules within subreddits were removed or at least relaxed more than they are. ',\n 'The age requirement for presidents is at the very least antiquated and at worst it undermines democracy. People should be able to elect leaders that represent them but this age limit creates a giant gap from where you have to elect someone from an older generation whose views dont align with yours as well as somebody younger. It makes no sense to place something like an age restriction on a republic because the entire point of a republic is to be able to elect who you want. While people below may not have the life experience of somebody older that is obviously going to be known to the public and the public can still make an informed decision. ',\n 'They have one goal and one goal alone to increase profits. There are many companies that do this by making customers happy and giving themselves a good public image but any good that is done by a company is an amoral action. Likewise any bad that is done by a company is also an amoral action. ompanies will do bad things if they are shown to be more profitable. The only way to stop this from happening is to make bad things less profitable. Legislation is a great way to do this but like everything has its caveats. As long as it is profitable for companies to influence legislation against the good of the people it will be done. They will fight against others to keep it profitable and to make it more profitable. The question is how do you keep bad things from being profitable and at the same time prevent business exodus? That really is the only issue. We dont need to keep them happy we just need to keep them from leaving. The USA still needs to be an attractive place to do business but not at the cost of the well being of its citizens as being an attractive place to do business is only wanted because it increases well being of the citizens of the country. Businesses are tools to increase the well being of people. Having empathy towards them is a wasted endeavor and only helps to hinder progress toward a better market. This definitely applies to all publicly traded companies as they have a responsibility to their shareholders and the only thing that the shareholders have in common is that they want their shares to be worth more. I dont know if it can apply blanketly to every outfit as the smaller a business gets the less people there are in charge and the business becomes more susceptible to human emotion. ',\n 'I was reading this thread  en are complaining that a woman would take HALF of their stuff money possessions assets etc if there is a divorce and so they are choosing not to get married because of that. And there are also posts from men who actually have lost half of their stuff to women in their own previous divorces. I dont feel bad about this and I kind of think most of these men are idiots and deserve it. The only way a man would lose HALF of his stuff a debatable term I agree but Ill continue to use it here for simplicity is if the man is earning of the income in a marriage and the woman is earning . A marriage is a business partnership that is ... so I cant help but think that men who marry unemployed and unemployable woman are idiots. Its comparable to starting a business with my highschool buddy who is broke and has nothing to actually invest in the business... youd have to be stupid to start a financialbusiness partnership in such circumstances. If Im going to start a business with someone Id expect they contribute half or at least close to half eg or more at the very least... otherwise they have very little nothing to lose and I have more to lose than my fair share. Women make about of what men make no? orrect me if Im wrong. So it shouldnt be too hard to find a potential wife that is at least in the same income bracketrange as the man correct? A man who marries a woman so far outside his income bracket is comparable to a man who invests and starts a business with a homeless bum and expects to share the losses if things go south. Why are men marrying women in what seems like large numbers based on the abovelinked post who have little to no earning ability? Why are they starting business partnerships with them? Why is it so hard to find a wife that has a job? Is the jobless rate for women that high? Or are unemployed and uneducated women simply more attractive? Are employed women not considered marriage material? WTF is going on? I guess in short I think people should marry others who earn similar to themselves and if they do otherwise are knowingly and consentually doing so with the understanding that they are carrying mostall of the financial risk. They shouldnt have a right to complain that they got finacially screwed when they consentually chose to be the only one to make a financial investment in their marriage. an someone help me see their side of the story because I genuinely dont see it and dont get it.

Then when I go online and see blog posts after blog posts about how waiting to lose their virginity after marriage was a terrible mistake like this one  I really cant help but feel that virgin marriages just dont work out in terms of sex life. I truly want to believe that people can wait until marriage to lose their virginity with the person they love. However Im starting to get worried because of all these people who arent being able to handle their sex lives after marriage. A personal request to everyone who replies I used to have the opinion that its completely fine to wait until marriage to have sex but these real life empirical examples all around me is the thing that is most discouraging to me. So if you can please try to speak from personal experience because knowing that Im hearing a true story about a real person will be more assuring to me than a very well educated opinion at this point.

Such as faulty equipment or offensive media or anything in between and people get up set a common argument is to ote with your wallet. In general this argument is a very poor one unless the business in question is so small that a tiny amount of consumer loss is significant. For companies like Walmart or EA or cdonalds voting with your wallet is inconsequential because for every product you refuse to buy not only are there sufficient people that will be satisfied with it but they are likely to buy in excess such that your proverbial wallet is accounted for in the big businesss pocketbook. This combined with a general lack of organization on the part of anyone standing in opposition to such companies you cannot actually vote with your wallet. Your vote gets cast for you and so your outrage is further justified because effectively there is nothing that can truly be done aking ote with your wallet. incredibly unrealistic and so not a viable or useful argument for contributing to discussion.

But have you ever really questioned what it takes to be considered a terrorist? Like what do you have to do exactly to be labeled as one? Do you need to blow up buildings kill innocent people think a certain way and be apart of a radical or religious group? Are you really immune as a U.S. citizen? How many innocent people are falsely labeled or punished? And who gets to decide? The problem with the war on terror is there will never be an end. It is the perfect war. Perfect for growing the military industrial complex adding to the increase of mass surveillance police militarization drone strikes and innocents being accused imprisoned or killed. It is a true modern day witchhunt. There will always be a terrorist because terrorism is an ideology. But as the years go by the word is being more and more loosely defined. By using the word terrorism to fight our enemies it has completely sheepified the population. It simply is a lot easier to get your way as a politician if you use it. In reality there is no black and white. The truth is people have different interests to them they are freedom fighters and heroes fighting for their values. We are probably even considered a terrorist to our terrorists. It is clear the war on terror has failed and has led nowhere besides a neverending cycle of fighting fire with fire or violence for violence. Lets take a new perspective. Lets start educating each other about our different viewpoints and cultures. Lets once and for all end the use of the words terrorism and terrorist. Instead lets work towards a greater understanding of the world and each other. The end of the neverending war starts with investment in education not the latest high tech weaponry.

Our society shoves the idea of a dream wedding down the throats of little girls convincing them to believe they want a pretty wedding and engagement ring. Really the money most people spend on these things could be put to much better use like a down payment on a car. An engagement ring serves zero purpose and weddings only last a day.

So killing them is morally okay as long as no others are harmed by this action like someone with a pet pig because no preference the animal has is being violated. However if meateating is a widespread taste and it is then market demand will necessarily and obviously lead to the most cost effective manner of raising and slaughtering animals. And the most cost effective manner of raising and slaughtering animals is one that produces a life of complete and relentless suffering through cramping disease being pecked to death the frustration of natural insticts etc. So meateating is wrong insofar as it necessarily leads to the inhumane practices of battery farming and no further. If we could live in a world where people would be content to eat meat sparingly as a luxury then meat eating would pose no ethical issue. However given how economies work demand for meat directly results in animal suffering. So I think vegans vegetarians AND meateaters are generally wrong about the ethics of meat.

I do not Refute that selfbuilt Ps are cheaper if you are looking for the best parts for the cheapest price. I also acknowledge that Ps are better for gaming. But macs have a large number of features not included with a desktop P. Also there is no downside other than said above to having a mac.

The Stratocaster has been played by greats such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric lapton. The Les Paul has been the mainstay of other great guitarists such as Slash and Zakk Wylde. By reputation alone either guitar would appear to be vitally important throughout the history of all forms of rock music. However I believe that the Stratocaster has a few important areas where it is superior. The Stratocaster is much more common in other genres of music than the Les Paul is. Great Blues artists like Buddy Guy Robert ray and Stevie Ray aughan all are known for playing Stratocasters. While country music is more known for the Stratocasters sibling the Telecaster you will see country artists like ince Gill play a Stratocaster from time to time. A good guitarist can get a wide range of sounds out of either the Les Paul or the Stratocaster but I believe the Stratocaster can offer more. Les Paul type guitars are equipped with dual coil humbucker pickups which combined with the weight and materials of the guitar are the reason for their iconic deep resonating sound. To make them more versatile most modern Les Pauls are equipped with coil tapping or coil splitting. The result is that you can make the pickups act more like a single coil. This eliminates the humbucking sort of a form of noise cancellation and sounds more stratlike. However it is still very far from the iconic honk you can get with a single coil Fender pickup. ost Stratocasters come in the SSS configuration which is three single coil pickups. If you turn up the volume on the guitar all the way and place the pickup selector to position it uses the middle and neck pickup together and sounds more similar to the sound you would get with a humbuckerequipped guitar than the humbuckerequipped guitars can sound like single coil. If that is not sufficient and you vastly prefer the sound of humbuckers Fender makes HSH and other pickup layouts to give you humbuckers. Ive never tried these so I cant really comment on them. Another feature that I feel is superior in the Stratocaster is the shape of the components of the guitar. The flat fretboard on the Les Paul has the strings a little too close together for my taste in comparison to the more roomy Stratocaster. Also the thinner neck makes it easier for me to wrap my thumb around if I were trying to play some chords similarly to how Jimi Hendrix would play them. The cutaway design of the body is much easier to deal with on the Stratocaster and allows easier access to the higher frets. The bridge is another factor for me since the bridge on the Les Paul sticks out further while the bridge on the Stratocaster is much lower making it easier to move your hand around while sticking close to the body of the guitar. That being said I will give some points to the Les Paul for the angled head being superior as well as the tuners being better on most Les Pauls that Ive played. That doesnt negate the other concerns though. To summarize I own and play both a Stratocaster and a Les Paul. y next guitar will probably be a PRS ustom because I feel like it provides a really good middle ground and has its own unique improvements over each. I love both guitars but I like my Stratocaster a little bit more. hange my view and explain to me how the Gibson Les Paul is a superior guitar.',\n 'Ive been bothered by all of the discussions about rape for a long time and I think Ive finally figured out why Rape is the only crime Im aware of where you can accuse someone and potentially even get them punished without real evidence. If I accused someone of robbing me the first that would be demanded is evidence. Without any evidence nobody would take my accusation seriously. But because so often theres no evidence in a rape case its become acceptable for evidenceless accusations to be taken seriously. Simply being accused of rape can get people fired from their jobs and destroy their life. Heres a great example of this where a student is carrying around a mattress until their accused rapist is expelled  At that point what their doing has nothing to do with the legal system theyre just shaming the entire system until someone gives into their demands. Thats not how it works. If theres not enough evidence to accuse someone of the crime if the court turns it down then you cant convict them. Period. Its not the court being blind to rape victims its that its better to let guilty people escape than to let one innocent suffer an established part of our legal system. In the end I wholeheartedly agree that rape is a horrible thing that we need to find a solution to. I just dont think that the solution lies in making it acceptable to accuse people without evidence rape or otherwise.',\n 'Ive been struggling with depression for the past six or seven years and have always found reasons to keep on keepin on. Lately however I just honestly dont see the point. We all die eventually and everything in between is pointless. Our lives dont matter the human race is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and all the arbitrary reasons we come up with to make our lives feel worthwhile depend on the axiom that life is worthwhile a view I dont personally share. However I know that the people I am close to in my life my girlfriend my parents my brother my few friends do not want me to die. Although I find it selfish of them to wish that I continue suffering so that they dont have to I also do not want to make their lives any worse by ending it all. So if anyone has a logical or philosophical reason for me to keep living I would be most appreciative to hear it. ',\n 'When talking about Depression people often say things like some people think people with Depression are just lazy but in fact its their brain chemistry making them behave that way. Okay certainly it is the case that folks with Depression have brain chemistry that causes their behavior. However that is also true of literally everyone else. There is no magical you that is distinct from your brain chemistry you are exactly the chemicals that make up your body no more and no less. The Depression is a part of you just like a broken or nonbroken leg is a part of you. Similarly so is Laziness. Lazy people have brains that incline towards being lazy just like Depressed people have brains that incline towards being depressed. It makes no sense to me to consider Depression to be a totally forgiveable medical condition that the sufferers of it cannot be blamed for their behavior but not do the same with Laziness. They should either both be considered victims of nature or neither should. I cannot see any natural way to draw a distinction between them. hange my view? ',\n 'So for anyone who lives under a rock a bunch of celebrity nudes were leaked from iloud. According to Wikipedia hackers targeted usernames passwords and security questions to get access to accounts. This event has been referred to as the Fappening. I have not personally seen these pictures nor do I intend on looking for them. With that said... When someone gets raped it doesnt matter what they were wearing that night. It doesnt make the act any more justifiable and rape is rape. I believe this to be true. I feel empathy for rape victims. Ive heard this compared to the Fappening many times. The victims privacy was violated. Its their prerogative to take whatever pictures they want and share them or not as long as no laws were violated e.g. being underage and no other people were hurt by the act. I agree with this. Where Im having trouble bridging the gap is here. There are laws in certain places saying that when a pedestrian is waiting at a crosswalk with no signals walk signs traffic lights etc. cars must stop and let the pedestrians cross. I know a friend that knows this law and doesnt really wait at the crossings assuming that cars will stop for him given a reasonable amount of time and space. ost people will wait until the cars actually stop. If he ever gets hit by a car at such a crosswalk it will be the drivers fault. The fact that someone else didnt follow the rules doesnt make my friend get hit by a car any less nor does it reduce the painfulness of the incident. Hes paying for it with his body and the law will probably make the driver pay for it as well. I would not feel bad for said friend because he took a risk with no possible reward got screwed by someone who didnt follow the rules and my friend ended up paying for it. By the same token I dont feel bad for the victims of the Fappening. At the same time I feel bad that I dont feel bad and as much as I hate the phrase it comes to mind here. Im sorry that Im not sorry. Other risks like owning a phonecarbikeetc. and risking that it gets stolen or you get injured in an accident going to bars and risking getting roofied or raped hooking up with someone at said bar and risking STDs or having them secretly film the encounter and so on carry a reward. In the case of a phonecarbike you get the convenience. In the case of going to bars and hooking up with people you get to drink have fun meet people and possibly get laid. If you decide to proceed anyway then to you those rewards outweigh the risks. I dont see any sort of reward for saving nude photos on your phone. Its all risk however small and theres nothing to be gained from it. In fact I think that its possible that they wanted the attention all along. I feel bad that I dont feel bad. ake me feel better. Please change my view. ',\n 'So for anyone who lives under a rock a bunch of celebrity nudes were leaked from iloud.

With that said I have no desire to have more than one child. If we only have one child well all be able to live a very comfortable life. We wont need to buy a larger house. Weve already started a college fund for the little guy and hell be able to go to any college in the country granted he need to earn his way in!. Well be able to buy a nice lake house in years or so. In short well be able ensure he gets all the resources hell ever need. If we have more than one those previously mentioned resources will be stretched more thinly. Dont get me wrong we wont go hungry if we have two children but we wont be able to fully fund two educations and still live the life we would have been able to with one child. oney and lifestyle aside were very thankful that hes the picture of health. What if we have a second and she isnt as healthy? Why ruin what you already know is a good thing? I guess I just do not see the value in having a second child. In my eyes less is more.

In that sense hyperrealistic works of art are vain narcissistic but beyond that pointless. A post came across my Facebook timeline a few days ago from Fubiz entitled Ultrarealistic Paintings by att Story. As with most posts on hyperrealistic drawings or paintings it got plenty of likes and ooohs and aaahs. I think hyperrealism is a bunch of bull however. To explain Id like to propose a couple of short thought experiment A man walks in a museum and comes across three identical photorealistic images hanging on the wall. His friend told him that one is a photograph one is a painting and one is a GI rendering but you cant tell which is which. Other than knowing that the images were created using three separate methods they look exactly alike. The man looks at the information plate on the wall below each image. The image in the middle is the photograph. This is just a photo of some fruit in a kitchen I couldve taken that. The image on the left is the GI rendering. Well I guess you can do anything on a computer these days. The image on the right is the painting. Wow I cant believe someone painted this! This is a masterpiece! A museum guide comes over looks at the information plates and says Im sorry sir someone changed these plates again. The image on the left is the photo the middle one the painting and the one on the right the GI rendering. The man responds Oh well then the left one is the masterpiece! Thought experiment Ten years from now D printing has advanced to the point where creating a lifesized model of a person is as easy as taking a photograph of someone. All of a sudden anyone can create a sculpture as realistic as any of Duane Hanson Some artists however continue making realistic sculptures the hard way with no discernible difference in outcome. I contend that the only difference between photography and hyperrealism is the degree of difficulty in creating the image. If sculpting technology makes realistic sculpting easier were a lot closer to thought experiment than you might expect than the only difference between lifelike sculptures becomes the process of creation. This is why I find the mans reaction in thought experiment so absurd and the artists in experiment who go the hard way vain and narcisstic. The image should be judged on the merit of itself not how it came to be. I could find arbitrarily difficult methods for creating the most mundane images and a lot of hyperrealistic subject matters seems to me to be rather banal but that doesnt make those images in and of themselves more compelling. If you create something which differentiates itself from another creation in no other way than having been harder to create the whole point of that creation becomes the process. In other words all that hyperrealistic artists seem to say is hey look at how amazing my skills are! I couldve just taken a photograph to show you the same image and I probably used a photograph to copy but I wanted everyone to see my awesome replicating skills! How is this not just an act of egostroking vanity and narcissism? I read elsewhere that the point of hyperrealism is to challenge our notion of what is real that you cannot trust your own eyes. By deceiving the viewer into believing something is real when it really isnt since it was painteddrawnetc. you make the viewer question the nature or reality itself. This is of course if the viewer can get over their amazement of the technical prowess of the artist to begin with. The thing that this purpose if thats what it is to challenge a viewers thoughts on whats real fails to reckon with is that photography itself is not real. Theres a story I remember reading cant source it unfortunately about a conversation between Picasso and a fellow train traveler who wonders why Picasso paints what he does. Picasso says I paint what I see. The man pulls out a photo from his wallet and says something to the effect of but thats not reality. See this photograph of my wife thats real. To which Picasso answers Youre wifes head is inches tall? The point is photographs are just representations of reality not reality itself. When a shallow depth of field puts parts of the image out of focus those areas arent in reality fuzzy all of a sudden its just how the camera interprets the light. Every little decision you make with a camera or which it makes for you influences how the camera captures and interprets the image. A photograph is the result of a complex interaction of light and the camera. Indeed when the actual creation of the camera is taken into account of the making of a photograph it turns out to be vastly more complex than painting a hyperrealistic painting. But lets limit ourself to the act of the buttonpusher. A photograph depicts the end result of this complex process between light and camera. In fact photography is much more successful in pretending to be real than hyperrealistic images ever could be because people actual think photos are real! And if hyperrealisms stated aim is to confound the boundaries between whats real and isnt by tricking the viewer than dont photoshopped images to job much more successfully? Or what about the fact that of Ikeas catalog is now computer generated ertainly fooled me. Is this the point of hyperrealism? What does that leave hyperrealism with then? The creational process. And really thats what gets the ooohs and aaahs isnt it? The realization that something handmade tricked you into thinking it was a photograph and an amazement for the skills of artist. This is not to say that we cannot or should not be awed by an act of creation. It is impressive to what degree artists can create photorealistic art. It takes time patience and technical skill to accomplish. But the end result should be judged on its own merit not on the extent to which it highlights the virtues of the artist. And since the end results of hyperrealistic art offers nothing beyond what a photograph could offer other than inflating the ego of the artist it is truly pointless. Would love for you to change my mind! Is there some other way Im not appreciating the genre of art? Thanks!

By deceiving the viewer into believing something is real when it really isnt since it was painteddrawnetc. you make the viewer question the nature or reality itself. This is of course if the viewer can get over their amazement of the technical prowess of the artist to begin with. The thing that this purpose if thats what it is to challenge a viewers thoughts on whats real fails to reckon with is that photography itself is not real. Theres a story I remember reading cant source it unfortunately about a conversation between Picasso and a fellow train traveler who wonders why Picasso paints what he does. Picasso says I paint what I see. The man pulls out a photo from his wallet and says something to the effect of but thats not reality. See this photograph of my wife thats real. To which Picasso answers Youre wifes head is inches tall? The point is photographs are just representations of reality not reality itself. When a shallow depth of field puts parts of the image out of focus those areas arent in reality fuzzy all of a sudden its just how the camera interprets the light. Every little decision you make with a camera or which it makes for you influences how the camera captures and interprets the image. A photograph is the result of a complex interaction of light and the camera. Indeed when the actual creation of the camera is taken into account of the making of a photograph it turns out to be vastly more complex than painting a hyperrealistic painting. But lets limit ourself to the act of the buttonpusher. A photograph depicts the end result of this complex process between light and camera. In fact photography is much more successful in pretending to be real than hyperrealistic images ever could be because people actual think photos are real! And if hyperrealisms stated aim is to confound the boundaries between whats real and isnt by tricking the viewer than dont photoshopped images to job much more successfully? Or what about the fact that of Ikeas catalog is now computer generated ertainly fooled me. Is this the point of hyperrealism? What does that leave hyperrealism with then? The creational process. And really thats what gets the ooohs and aaahs isnt it? The realization that something handmade tricked you into thinking it was a photograph and an amazement for the skills of artist. This is not to say that we cannot or should not be awed by an act of creation. It is impressive to what degree artists can create photorealistic art. It takes time patience and technical skill to accomplish. But the end result should be judged on its own merit not on the extent to which it highlights the virtues of the artist. And since the end results of hyperrealistic art offers nothing beyond what a photograph could offer other than inflating the ego of the artist it is truly pointless. Would love for you to change my mind! Is there some other way Im not appreciating the genre of art? Thanks! ',\n 'tldr Hyperrealistic paintingsdrawings offer nothing beyond what a photograph could offer with the exception of displaying the technical skills of an artist. In that sense hyperrealistic works of art are vain narcissistic but beyond that pointless. A post came across my Facebook timeline a few days ago from Fubiz entitled Ultrarealistic Paintings by att Story. As with most posts on hyperrealistic drawings or paintings it got plenty of likes and ooohs and aaahs. I think hyperrealism is a bunch of bull however. To explain Id like to propose a couple of short thought experiment A man walks in a museum and comes across three identical photorealistic images hanging on the wall. His friend told him that one is a photograph one is a painting and one is a GI rendering but you cant tell which is which. Other than knowing that the images were created using three separate methods they look exactly alike. The man looks at the information plate on the wall below each image. The image in the middle is the photograph. This is just a photo of some fruit in a kitchen I couldve taken that. The image on the left is the GI rendering. Well I guess you can do anything on a computer these days. The image on the right is the painting. Wow I cant believe someone painted this! This is a masterpiece! A museum guide comes over looks at the information plates and says Im sorry sir someone changed these plates again. The image on the left is the photo the middle one the painting and the one on the right the GI rendering. The man responds Oh well then the left one is the masterpiece! Thought experiment Ten years from now D printing has advanced to the point where creating a lifesized model of a person is as easy as taking a photograph of someone. All of a sudden anyone can create a sculpture as realistic as any of Duane Hanson Some artists however continue making realistic sculptures the hard way with no discernible difference in outcome. I contend that the only difference between photography and hyperrealism is the degree of difficulty in creating the image. If sculpting technology makes realistic sculpting easier were a lot closer to thought experiment than you might expect than the only difference between lifelike sculptures becomes the process of creation. This is why I find the mans reaction in thought experiment so absurd and the artists in experiment who go the hard way vain and narcisstic. The image should be judged on the merit of itself not how it came to be. I could find arbitrarily difficult methods for creating the most mundane images and a lot of hyperrealistic subject matters seems to me to be rather banal but that doesnt make those images in and of themselves more compelling. If you create something which differentiates itself from another creation in no other way than having been harder to create the whole point of that creation becomes the process. In other words all that hyperrealistic artists seem to say is hey look at how amazing my skills are! I couldve just taken a photograph to show you the same image and I probably used a photograph to copy but I wanted everyone to see my awesome replicating skills!

Ive seen most if not all of the photos since then. I gave to the PF and again to Water.org when PF didnt want reddits money. I was reading the SRD thread about the charity drama this morning and was surprised by the difference of opinion between the communities. I dont think Im some cancer solving savior for giving to charity in the name of Jennifer Lawrences nude photos but it seemed like a good way to make a silver lining out of something that was indeed bad for many celebrities people whos private photos were leaked. No its not ideal but there wasnt ever going to be a silver lining in the form of people collectively abstaining from looking. Anyway the reason why most people seem to be on the side of the charity for making the PR decision that they did is this fundamental idea that I differ on. That looking at these leaked photos makes everyone involved a bunch of pervy peeping toms. Im totally against such violations of privacy that resulted in the leak and I think that whoever is responsible should be held accountable and responsible and be charged with whatever crimes they committed. But I just cant see how being a bystander to the real crime being committed is a violation of privacy as well. I think about all the porn out there I know some photos of random girls have to have been from a boyfriend or ex that were uploaded without the girls permission. But I dont see anyone worry about that or anyone who cares and I dont see how thats different from this and in regards to my example I dont see how ignorance as to whether it actually was a private photo excuses or negates the moral rightness or wrongness of it. And if weve silently agreed that those types of photos are okay why arent these? I get lost or stuck on that last point but if Im on the wrong side of things here Id like to know and I welcome someone taking the time to explain it to me.

',\n 'People that take a stand against same sex marriage typically will use any number of irrational and illogical arguments. One of the most common is that gay marriage somehow cheapens their marriage or that marriage is between defined as being between a man and a woman. Ignoring the glaring flaw that marriage is specifically not defined as between a man and a woman in America people should be looking at this stance as religious intolerance. first off their are christian churches that are willing to marry Gay people. So right off the bat to take this stand against gay marriage is being intolerant against certain forms of christianity. any Buddhist sects are also accepting of gay marriage. So when you look at the fact that multiple different religions have opposing views how could you possibly come to any conclusion other than the fact that you are being intolerant of other religious traditions? The part of my title that mentions civil unions is a response to another common argument by anti gay marriage advocates which is that they just dont think it should be called marriage between same sex partners. This still falls under the category of being intolerant because you are trying to dictate what their religious beliefs label their union but it brings up another concern. If you think that marriage is a religious term why do you think the government should be issuing marriage certificates to anybody when we are supposed to have a separation of church and state in this country? Shouldnt it be the same as most of the rest of the world where you can get a government union and then have a religious ceremony separately? ore specifically why would it be okay to create a law that specifically creates inequality? ',\n 'In honor of my first cakeday here is a . oral character is the only or at least by far the most heavilyweighted aspect by which I judge other individuals. It seems that people are often judged by their wealth fame or success but those things pale in comparison to moral capacity in my opinion. It is difficult to respect people who are selfish sociopathic callous or just evil no matter how successful their other accomplishments are. IANAPhilospher but this might be related to the question of deontology vs consequentialism. Basically even if they better other peoples lives however that manifests through immoral means or intentions they are immoral. This is also related to the legal concept of mens rea. Although I bring these up as related hopefully discussions wont evolve completely into conversation about these concepts. Inversely I think it is easy to respect people who are demonstrably moral but not conventionally successful. Even if they are not famous or wealthy or productive in a career as long as they are moralethical they deserve and earn my respect. I invite you to discuss and ! ',\n 'Although they might seem corny to some fistbumps as they will be known in future with no space between the words are a physical greeting that are better than handshakes in a number of ways that I will try to explain below. While they might currently be associated with douchebag bros this is an unnecessary association which will disappear over time and as such will not be accepted as an argument against their use. Sweatyclammy hands Some people are unfortunately genetically disposed to sweat more than others and having sweaty hands makes a handshake an unpleasant encounter for both the sweaty handed person who feels shame and the recipient who was expecting a dry hand. Fistbumps only result in contact with the tops of the fingers which tend to be dry for all people except perhaps some freaks. Germ exposure The palm of the hand is used for many daily activities such as scratching ones balls holding onto filthy handrails and squishing flies in a clap. Despite frequent hand washing icky bacteria is inevitably going to end up on your hands at several points during the day. The top of your hand however is rarely used and is therefore mostly free of germs and microbes that might want to transmit a cold or ebola. Speed and efficiency. A fistbump establishes a sense of camaraderie and kinship in just a second whereas a handshake can take several seconds to complete at a greater personal investment to both parties. In a working environment where you might have to greet many people each morning a fistbump saves time which could be spent working on important projects while still convincing your colleagues that you are happy to see them. As a side note a fistbump can be easily followed by a hug if more intimacy is required in the greeting or can be followed up by a quick sideways high five. aking a fizzling or dissolving fistbump is not in my opinion acceptable and will not be accepted in any counter arguments. ',\n 'Not all will succeed First off I am conservative not that the term means anything these days. However as a conservative I would love to have my view changed on welfare. I believe we need welfare. And not because the rich ruling class wants to subdue poor people and keep them down. Everyone knows that lighting a fire under most people would get them to strive for more but not all will and many will fail to succeed. I believe some will commit suicide turn to prostitution rob steal riot etc. Economy Assuming every former welfare recipient finds employment the job market would become oversaturate. This get a job you slacker! mentality is simply unrealistic. Special programs and regulations would have to be in place to hire a certain percentage of unskilled worker instead of qualified workers. I have heard the current state of welfare compared to slavery but welfare is free money to the recipient slavery more equates to working for minimum wage with no feasible escapement. Even with minimum wage there is a chance possibly small that one can work their way up or transition to a better job. As a rightleaning individual I think capitalism is a good thing. It is far from perfect but I believe it gives many people a chance. Welfare doesnt really give anything but sustenance. Welfare can be viewed as a result of capitalism. Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalists game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is we are getting stingy with our scraps. The new Laws Now laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons including costs. However the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents and for good reason fuck em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers. If welfare were to be rapidly dismantled I believe the US would be in a worse state. Even holding conservative views I believe welfare is a necessary evil. hange my view. ',\n 'NOTE I have no intention of any sort of self harm.

Just about everybody believes this to be an insane breach of privacy with Jennifer Lawerences PR going as far to threaten to prosecute those who post the images Others have gone on to say that those who view the photos shouldnt complain about the NSA or privacy y view is that there are a couple things wrong with this. Firstly the distinction between private and public. To me something is private when its ownership belongs to an exclusive group of people. In this case the group was the photo takers and whoever they shared those photos with Apple not withstanding. When the hacker obtained the photos and released them to the public the group was nonexclusive now anybody who has access to a computer can view the photos and thus the photos arent private theyre public. Ideally those photos should belong to the photo takers and thus those who spread the photos are spreading ownership and making them more public which is wrong. Id like to remind everyone I dont think what the hacker and those who share the images are right. Now that the photos are public its not a matter of privacy to view the photos. I can still be mad at the NSA for breaching my privacy however if the NSA made my information or others public I could not be mad at them for solely looking at it as long as they didnt do anything with the information. I would still be mad at the NSA as I am with the hacker however unlike my private information you cant use the leaked pictures to hack into my bank account or find out where I live or find out where I go to school. With that said Id like like to make my points a little clearer for easier view changing What the hacker and the people who spread the images do are wrong. Its perfectly ok to view the photos. Youre not a hypocrite if you view those photos and dislike the NSA.

This view of the Human Body as being forbidden is part of what creates situations like this in the first place.

',\n 'I think American government deliberately programs the conscience of its citizens since their childhood by altering their perception of the reality with false and distant from scientific truth beliefs. It portrays its authority in the form of a supernatural power who bears stateimposed American values and fights the evil. Disney movies portray the kings and queens as noble and just people that should be trusted and revered without a question. We are taught to dualize things into evil and good so do these movies but in a very exagerated form. Watching supernatural abilities of the heros kids will have false understanding of the reality. This is what generally religions do. They stupidify people separate concepts into good and bad form beliefs in magical phenomenons. You cannot scrape these values once you are an adult because whatever you did in your childhood is the dearest and kindest memory you can never oppose. Somewhere in your heart you will believe in those false ideas lies that are initially meant to control your. Kinda develop Stockholm syndrome with them if you like. Why not to make movies that are closer reality to nature and its physical laws? ovies that teach us how to think rationally scientifically? Why should we need to be so primitive? I used to watch Soviet cartoons which are diametrically different from the ones produced in the US. Soviet cartoons do not impose false ideas they are simply about humane feelings like kindness friendship love and courage. Some even show the methods science or how we can live in harmony with nature. Ironically it turns out that a state which is deemed to be closed and authoritarian had tried to educate its people make them closer to the reality while the most democratic and free state of the world systematically programs the minds of its people through releasing crappy tales about supernatural being which is nothing but a modern form of religion.',\n 'The habit of establishing monogamous relationships for the purpose of child bearing is one that has been more beneficial to societies than the habit of polygamy or other familiar structures. The formalities that surround it arose out of a necessity to know who is supposed to be responsible for which kids which people are supposed to inherit the property of diseased people and so on. For several thousand years it has been the duty of clergy and religious institutions to formalize monogamous relationships into marriage which is still the case in several countries. Only recently with the advent of suprareligious states brought about by the French Revolution has it been made into a secular issue. It wasnt something that people only started doing after someone voted for a law to bureaucratize it but the other way round it was something that was good and only then did states decide to appropriate it for their own sake. The state doesnt regulate marriage because its good for people. It does so because it is good for itself. The modern State is more powerful and overbearing than any institution that has ever existed in human history. It has no business regulating human relationships. ',\n 'In a recent conversation about distant potential EU regulations and the future of a centralised decision to standardise electrical outlets similarly to the micro USB charger I have begun to hold the opinion that the British plug and socket is much better than the europlug possibly even the best in the world. I normally dont like such nationalistic thinking but I feel justified. y friend accused the British socket of being over engineered. I shall begin by arguing against this point of contention. It would be over engineered if it had superfluous features but it does not. The British BS Type G system has several safety features and some for convenience. The longer top blade rd pin . Earthing for protection from shocks. . By inserting the tip of the earth pin into the top earth receptor the A terminals are opened mechanically for the other two pins to enter children could not accidentally shock themselves without wedging something in the earth terminal first. . Provides clear way up guidance for ease of use. The plug . an be fused to protect appliancesuser. Edit e.g. power surge. . Has the flexible cable leaving perpendicular to the pins so people are not tempted to disengage by yanking the cable. . Insulated pins. The socket . Has a switch on the wall for an extra safety feature and to be able to stop power without needing to unplug. . Flat so you know when the plug is fully in visually. This looks better on the wall. Things dont slip out once they are in even heavy adaptors. As for international credentials it is used in around countries worldwide. The safety and convenience mark it out to be the best in class to my mind. It should be adopted globally as the international standard over any other. hange my view. ',\n 'I believe if a former drug addict manages to maintain sobriety for a sufficient period of time to be considered sober this shouldnt be celebrated and applauded as an act of courage or something to admire but rather be treated as a return to status quo. In my opinion if you willfully become addicted to chemicals that is a problem you have created yourself. You have dug that hole and fallen below societys status quo on drug use. If you then manage to maintain sobriety you will then be considered in line with status quo again arguably lower even then since you became addicted in the first place. Some people stay sober their entire lives and are never given accolades or congratulations. The same should logically apply to former addicts. Saying I havent funded my crack habit for a year is roughly equivalent to saying I take adequate care of my pets or I wear clothes in public it is conforming to the baseline of status quo as well as the law and shouldnt be considered with admiration or praise. Furthermore crimes such as petty theft or assault are frequently commited during addiction and these crimes are seen as forgiven or forgotten once a person achieves sobriety as if resolving the individual of responsibility for his actions as well as his choices. This is NOT a drugs use . This is specifically related to addiction and societys views on sobriety. ',\n 'Before I get burned at the stake let me set a few facts out.

Giving that up is not an unselfish act its an act of self degradation. The ability to embrace your partners acts of desire is the truly unselfish act.

In many places this includes a cash handout. I believe this is wrong on many levels. The money may be misspent. This idea is NOT based on the assumption that poor people are all stupid or drug addicts. Its simply the fact that theres no way of ensuring that the cash is used for its intended purpose. The best assumption you can make is that people would be so desperately craving the thing you give them extra money for that they would almost certainly spend it on that but people may end up endure forms of squalor that were far from what the well intentioned policy makers had in mind. From the governments perspective money is also being spent inefficiently. Lets say a program wanted to ensure that people were well fed. Theyd have to find a cash amount that would buy enough healthy food to feed the recipients but people have different needs so theyll have to provide to the upper percentile of demand the alternative is weighing people paying women less etc. This not only will result in discretionary income but inequality in how much everyone gets. A food stamp system would allow everyone to get as much food as they need and the money left over is still in the governments hands to spend on other initiatives. Things like food stamps are patronising and thats a good thing. A cash handout creates a sense of entitlement beyond what something patronising like food stamps rent vouchers etc. create. By the time moneys in your pocket or bank account theres several layers between you and the people providing that service. Food stamps create a meaningful difference between working poor and welfare recipients to encourage escaping the system. Theres also the huge benefit of less resentment of those on welfare. In general they communicate purpose more clearly. Too often theres an attitude of getting as much money as you can from the government and paying as little tax as possible. It seems like people would be less likely to trick their way into receiving food stamps education and other initiatives purpose built to meet needs. On the other side I would think policies would allow people to see their taxes as less of a redistribution of wealth and more as funding for benevolent programs to create a better society. I think as much welfare as possible should be in the form of vouchers and other purpose specific non discretionary forms. I like food stamps I like rent vouchers I like free healthcare and education. Things like these over cash seem like the best way to prevent the safety net becoming a fishing net. I cant think of many situations where cash is the best option which is why Im here. The other aspect to this changemyview is that Im ok with policies that patronise the less fortunate. Being well fed healthy comfortably sheltered continually educated to eventually earn the life you want are more important than not being insulted. If anyone can enlighten me on what its like to be offended by a government policy assuming youre stupid or malevolent especially if you dont pay taxes that would be helpful.',\n 'Before starting Im aware that there are different kinds of asexuality the specific type Im referring to is aromantic asexuality meaning you dont feel nor sexual or romantic attraction towards anyone. Im a heterosexual male and I believe my sexuality is setting me back in my life goal which is to achieve as much as possible. Relationships are tedious time consuming and even though Ive had a fair share of them they pretty much always end with one getting a broken heart. This could all have been prevented by being not being in a relationship from the beginning which is kind of hard unless youre asexual because its pretty much human nature. Also our sexuality pretty much makes us vulnerable to other people who can use it for their own gain. This includes adverts celebrities pretty much all common media. Keeping all these distractions out of the way will make it easier to focus on a single goal therefore being able to advance as far as possible in life.

Its an amazing thing nevertheless I respect those of you if any of you reading this are challenged to live off of it. Now to my view on the W matter its an artificial ideology that should only be increased or manipulated in any way artificiallyby the fed in cases of an extreme change of the economy or the market. It should be eradicated to the point of only increasing or decreasing based off the economy at that point in time. As of now its the federal government stepping in and increasing the state W. It should be there as a measurement of the inflation of currency and state of the market and to avoid any unfair affairs that would ensue based off a complete ridding of the W. By increasing it were inflating the dollar and thus not actually paying our workers more for what they already do. Based off that statement alone we can infer the offered pay of jobs what that position is worth. Flipping burgers at a cDonalds is not worth as a lot of politicians might make it out to be. Its a job that is easily replaceable by automation. As previously stated by increasing the wages of lower tier workers were not helping them. The dollar is being inflated and so is worth less. They essentially have what they already have. Just in biggeryet proportional numbers. Furthermore our businesses will be the most affected by the increase of the W. Having to pay more for a worker for doing the same job from before is a terrible business move. They will have to lay off more workers in order to compensate for their deficit just based off labor cost. Ive left out a lot of details in the debate over W so keep in mind this isnt even scratching the surface. These are observations everyone can make obviously but on an indepth level there could be some positives to increase. Feel free to criticize my lack of indepth knowledge on the matter. Thanks for your time! ',\n 'There are a lot of movements for accepting previously criticized groups such as fat acceptance nerd acceptance ... You get the idea. Sure those movements make people feel better about themselves but it makes them content with who they are thinking theres nothing wrong with it and not try to improve. Theres a reason why they were traditionally thought of as weird. For example the fat acceptance movement makes obese people think there is nothing wrong with their bodies and ignore the health risks of being obese. While some nerds possess moderate social skills a lot of them dont have social skills good enough to make one friend in an anime convention of thousands of people. According to a poll used for an anime Family Feud in an anime convention at least make friends in a day convention with people of similar interests. Thats absurd. I cant speak for fat acceptance but as a previous nerd with no social skills it was the feeling of rejection that made me improve and push myself to hone my social skills. If the acceptance movements were around back then I would be happier as a nerd but Id still have friends. Thats not to say that I am no longer a nerd I still have all my previous interests but I know when to talk about things I know not to correct people too much I know how to make small talk and in general be able to deal with people. As for fat acceptance it may not be an issue in a country where people pay for their own healthcare but in a country like anada where everyone pays for healthcare this is an issue that affects everyone.

Yes I cant practically treat them equally I form relationships with some of them some of them are my boss etc. But thats not what I am talking about. I am talking about basic courtesies and forming informed opinions about people. It is irrelevant to me if one race or group is advantaged in some area as morally I think all humans are equal. However I am not a perfect person. If I do follow research which in some case might show some race as advantaged in some way or mentally or physically inferior I am afraid that it might form in me some kind of bias. It doesnt have to be race per se but any sort of grouping. ountry language grouping etc. This will not change my opinion on how this group must be treated morally but it might poison my perspective. I do not want this. I dont see any good that will come out of it. Is there any good reason to inform myself about such things? Now I am not interested in whether such trends have so far been shown to exist. In principle it could be possible and the underpinnings of my moral framework are independent of what such findings might reveal. Now I dont believe this to be true but if we study enough groupings we might find some generalisation which is sufficiently robust. I am not a law or policy maker. I am not a doctor. I am not an administrator. I am an engineer. I do not have to form policy around such trends. I do not have to look for certain diseases. I dont see how it is relevant to me. Why should I potentially inform myself about such trends? What good will come of it? What good can come of it? I expect the major response to this would be race isnt real. Thats a rabbit hole I dont think is particularly pertinent here and I am sure there is some sort of grouping which is better and the same issues would exist. So... ?

That being said I have no idea why anyone is bothering to defend Zoe Quinn. It seems like what she did was pretty evil. She cheated lied and took part in nepotism. If even half of the allegations against her are true she was an abusive girlfriend and a terrible person. I get that women are harassed a lot in the gaming community and that is wrong. But why is Zoe being defended? Would anyone mind explaining to me? Relevant The article that specifically influenced me to post here was this  ',\n 'Posting with a throwaway as my position manages to offend both sides of the spectrum. For a long time I believed that abortion was immoral but I eventually became convinced based largely on utilitarian grounds that abortion was permissible. So why do I believe that most abortions are immoral? For an act to be moral doesnt just mean that it is permissible according to ethics but you need to actually know that it is moral. ost people dont understand the issue well enough to know abortion is moral. In fact most or at least a large proportion of people dont know much of anything. For example only of people dont believe that global warming is caused by human activity. Only of people in the US believe in evolution of registered voters believe Obama is a uslim Of those a large percent probably only say that they believe in evolution or global warming because their friends do. If their friends said the opposite then theyd probably think that the scientists were just making it up too. So thats on scientific issues that are relatively clear cut. Philosophical issues are much more messy. What percentage of people male and female do you believe actually understand the issue and arent just quoting whatever theyve heard other people say? From the way that these discussions go it seems to be very small. Lots of people identify viability as the point where a foetus deserves moral consideration but they cant articulate a reason why theoretical ability of foetus to survive outside of a womb should be connected to metaphysical rights indeed this is a weak argument philosophically. any people try to construct a right of bodily autonomy but the situations differ in the important respect that the mother knowing put themselves in a position where there was a risk of pregnancy. Because of this distinction bodily autonomy doesnt work as a contradiction argument only as an analogy to aid intuition. Now while there are strong philosophically justified utilitarian grounds and other more nuanced arguments within other moral frameworks I would be surprised if more than of the population could provide a logically coherent argument. To be clear Im sure that many of the people here can restructure these arguments to be much more logically coherent except that isnt really the point here the point is that most people are logically incoherent. Objection Does any of this matter? If someone does something that is morally acceptable and they believe that it is morally acceptable then arent they in the clear? Not quite. Someone has to also take due diligence. Suppose someone who believes in utilitarian ethics is going to go back in time and kill Hitler. This will have a good result it will save millions of lives and they strongly believe this. But before they get a chance they run into another timetraveller with an oracle machine that can tell them if their action is good or bad perhaps another leader will take over who kills even more than Hitler. If they choose to put their hands in their ears and not listen to the oracle their act to kill Hitler cannot be considered moral because they were gambling with millions of lives by changing the course of world history and ignoring evidence that might have shown it disastrous. This applies even if the result is that they save millions of lives. The point is that for an action to be moral it isnt sufficient for it to be morally acceptable and for the person to believe that it is morally acceptable but one needs to also take an appropriate level of care when coming to that decision. In the same way human life is hugely valuable and someone who has an abortion without making a rather significant effort to ensure that they understand the issue is acting immorally as they are not taking the appropriate level of care. ost people if they were truly honest would have to admit that they dont really understand the issue and therefore cannot be justified in having an abortion without knowing that they have solid arguments to support their position. hange my view. ',\n 'When someone is in high school it does not make sense to have a committed romantic relationship. Romantic relationship is defined as a mutual agreement of exclusivity in dating and being referred to as together. The first point I have is that in a purely practical sense dating should be seen from a breadth first approach. It is more pragmatic to date many people and learn what your particular tastes are than to learn it by stumbling through a series of relationships that fall apart and tripping right into the next one. This is emotionally taxing. Second as teenagers have not matured enough yet to what they will be as adults. You cant really understand the significance of that intimacy at that time. One just is not ready until a later age Third relationships are distracting expensive and time consuming. High school is often what decides the course of someones life and it is not wise to mess with something that powerful. I have seen many people throw their lives away for their boyfriend or girlfriend and it seems that it just is not worth the risk. Answer this and I will be convinced Is it vital that someone gets relationship experience in high school? Would in not be bennifical to date noncommittally until after graduation? To support this I point to the statistic brought up by utomrhod ... A closer look at even these lower rates indicate that there are really two separate groups with very different rates a woman who is over has a college degree and an independent income has only a percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce a woman who marries younger than without a college degree and lacking an independent income has a percent probability of her marriage ending in divorce.

',\n 'Whenever I hear a schools teachings on antibullying I often see a very dangerous idea being taught to every student. To me activehelpful bystander henceforth known as active bystander mentality is an irresponsible teaching because it is dangerous relieves the school of a lot of responsibility and weakens the success rate of stopping bullying. Being an active bystander is dangerous because it redirects the flow of aggression from the previous victim to the person who decided to intervene. The aggression could be anything from just hateful words being thrown to something as severe as a lifeendingcrippling weapon being pointed at the new defender not necessarily a gun maybe a knife or something else. It forces the defender to cover both himherself as well as the initial victim. On top of this if there are other bystanders who choose to be harmful harmful bystanders now the defender has to defend against or more people. This on top of the fact that the victim may or may not be helpful in the repelling of the bully helps to ensure that from a safety point being an active bystander is not the best idea. Active bystanders also remove much of the burden from the school. When schools essentially appoint everyone as a militia against bullying it rids itself of much of the duty to detect bullying as it happens. As I mentioned earlier active bystanders themselves may not be powerful enough to even stop the threat. Without the cooperation of the school overall people will have a much weaker antibullying effort. If a fight actually takes place the school can just shrug it off by enforcing zeropolicy and suspend both the active bystander. This doesnt even solve the problem for a few reasons. The bully either a didnt mean what they saiddid and just had their emotions get in the way therefore feeling like they were unfairly treated or b dont care about school or their peers and do this for whatever reason they want to. For the defender well they just got rekt due to their fail at bullying and from the victims perspective they probably feel cheated for getting punished for something they could not control. y view could be changed if someone could find a better solution that repels the bully nulls the aggression and gives the schools some responsibility. Please convince me if I got something wrong about my logic. ',\n 'With regards to sandwiches triangular cuts are far superior to rectangular cuts and should be the only ones ever used. Every time I use sliced bread I end up cutting it triangularly. Toast sandwiches grilled cheese etc. I think it is the best way and that sandwiches on traditional sliced bread should be cut this way. So Im not referring to subsetc. I will also allow patti melts as an exception although I prefer them cut still. y boyfriend barely ever slices sandwiches when he cooks and when he does he tends to go with rectangular. ost likely to spite me because I cant think of any reason to ever use that style of cutting. So my views are that sandwiches should always be sliced and they should be sliced in a triangular fashion from corner to corner with the above noted exceptions and specifications. First a sliced sandwich is always superior to one that has not been sliced. It allows you direct access to the middle where the most flavor is. It also cuts down on the amount of crumbs created. You are also able to completely avoid eating the crust this way if you prefer. Second the triangular slice is always superior to the rectangular slice. If you have a dipping sandwich such as grilled cheese with tomato soup the triangular shape allows you to fit the sandwich into a container much easier since you have a smaller tip. They also fit around a bowl much easier as triangles. can also regulate how much of the sandwich you bit off easier. You can see much more of the insides of the sandwich to inspect where you might want to bite. The triangle is a stronger shape than a rectangle so you can support the sandwich with less effort. When you eat the insides of the sandwich the triangle leaves a much more manageable crust than the rectangular cuts. uNepene gets a delta for convincing me that rectangle cut is superior in ONLY ONE WAY when transporting in ziplock baggies. And that it is an acceptable option although inferior option when eating a sandwich that would involve dipping in soup. I dont think there are any other situations where a rectangle cut would be better or acceptable. ',\n '.

It seems to require much less thought and effort than actually coming up with a way to bring the song to a close and its highly unsatisfying to me. The fade out is usually during several repetitions of the chorus which in and of itself seems like lazy songwriting. If the song has said all it has to say repeating the chorus over and over again isnt going to improve or enhance it at all. Its just filler and I suspect thats often how its used to flesh out a song enough to make it long enough to play on the radio. Alternately I suppose that the purpose could be to keep that catchy hook in peoples heads and keep them wanting more which is good marketing but does not necessarily make it a better song. For another thing that wouldnt fly in any other art form. Okay I think this book is long enough. Ill just throw in some ellipses and...done! People are probably tired of this play by now lets just close the curtains and dim the lights. The only exception to this I can think of is if the story arc is genuinely concluded and the ending is supposed to be ambiguous or were supposed to get the impression that things keep going as usual. I cant think of an equivalent in music but feel free to correct me. Also how is that supposed to work in a live performance? Does the sound guy just gradual turn down the volume? Does everyone bring it down to a whisper? Do they actually write an ending to the song but choose to fade it out in the recording for some reason? y view could be potentially be changed by the following but by no means feel you have to limit yourself to these . Examples of songs that use a fadeout artfully and for a purpose. Bonus points if you can point out a song that has a written conclusion but sounds better and is improved by a fade out. . Input from recording artists or producers that have decided to end a song this way and their reasoning behind it. Note that these reasons should be musical because it actually made the song better and not for marketing time constraints or other purposes. Fades work as a transition in the context of an album or longer piece of music. usical endings are no more difficult to pull off than fades. Fades can contribute to a feeling of endlessness which is sometimes appropriate to the theme or tone of the song.

A person pulling in million a year taxed at the absurd rate of would be living a significantly more luxurious life than someone making a year taxed at . I cant imagine someone waking up one day and thinking It would be pointless to even try to do something more with my life because Ill just get taxed at a higher rate. I believe that peoples drive to work hard stems from their internal desires to contribute to society and live a more luxurious life not the percentage at which they will be taxed.

I went to different retailers and in the first two all the mice that they sold were wireless. In the third store I finally found one and it was the last one they had in stock and it was in the clearance part of the store most likely meaning that this is their last one in stock and they dont plan on restocking it. This got me thinking I think its dumb how popular wireless mice have gotten when considering how much better wired mice are. Here are some reasons why I think they are better. Wired ice are way cheaper. I bought mine for and all the other wireless mice started for at least . Wired ice dont need batteries so they wont run out of battery midgame or during anything important meaning that you wont have any interruptions. The wire makes it easy to keep track of as it is connected to the computer so swiping it accidentally off of your desk youll still be able to find it. Its a much more reliable connection and doesnt randomly disconnectstop working while using it where as in my experience wireless mice fade in and out occasionally. ?',\n 'Its occurred to me several times in the past few years that I take far fewer pictures than my peers.

Are you so insecure that you need everyone to agree with you at all times? That seems unbelievably childish to me.

That seems to be an absurd and hypocritical standard that the right wing media seems to enjoy holding when its convenient. That said I think its politically and morally tone deaf for a President to have a press conference about the very public and gruesome beheading of an American Journalist and then go directly to the golf course. I also think because of Reddits left leaning bias if this had happened with a Republican in the White House this kind of story would be on the front page or at least on the front of rpolitics.

',\n 'This thread was motivated by the commentary in this rworldnews thread  If you havent been following the news an extremist group called ISIS recently released a video showing their execution of an American journalist along with some propaganda for their cause and a warning to those who would resist them. Police in England are warning that it may be illegal to download or distribute this video. I dont think its too hard to understand my view. ISIS created a video which required irreversible harm to someone in order to create. They arent interested in making a monetary profit theyre interested in spreading their message to people. When you view the video youre showing them that there is demand for more of this content and theyve demonstrated theyre willing to kill more prisoners. The family of James Foley has gone on the record requesting that people dont view the video out of respect for James. hild pornography can be created for a few different reasons. A large amount of child pornography is created not for profit but simply to exchange with others. These videos and images may require irreversible harm in their creation and by downloading and viewing them you are creating a demand for further production of that content. I would imagine that given the choice the victims of child pornography and their families would give the same plea that the Foley family did to avoid watching or spreading the video. Its interesting to me that everyone in the rworldnews thread thought it was completely absurd to make viewing the execution illegal while Im fairly sure none of them would want to legalize free child pornography. Im not advocating that either of these things should be legal or illegal Im just having a hard time understanding why they occupy such a different legal space in much of the world. One argument I forsee is that many people are downloading the Foley video out of a morbid curiosity while people who download child pornography are doing so to enjoy the content. Whether or not I enjoy content is of little concern. The fact remains that if I enjoy child pornography I would continue to view it again and if I had the morbid curiosity to view an execution I would likely have that same urge the next chance I got. There are also people viewing the Foley video in parts of the world which support ISIS so I dont believe that there is nobody enjoying it. Thanks in advance for any input!

',\n 'A weapon in the hand of an officer gives them the capability to essentially become judge jury and yes sometimes executioner. This leaves too many people at risk. In Ferguson you not only have the lethal shooting of ichael Brown but a crowd control cop threatening to kill protesters. In Toronto Sammy Yatim a mentally ill man was gunned down on a streetcar when advancing on a police officer with a knife. The cop is now on trial but the young man is still dead. What Yatim needed was interaction with a medical professional which also has me wondering if we should be rethinking the role of police. What is the meaning of serve and protect? Perhaps only in extreme cases should police be permitted to carry lethal weapons and perhaps only highly ranked officers should be permitted to carry a firearm. There are also a lot of nonlethal weapons available now and while we must be careful that officers dont abuse those as well the risk associated with cops decision to use their firearm is that it will result in a fatality something the victim or suspect or perp will never come back from.

But in light of events like officers pointing guns at peaceful protestors or at media I have been overcome with rage everytime I see cops get away with behaviour like this. Even worse when I came to the realization that these sort of thing probably happens every day and it isnt until todays era that we can finally have proof thanks to cameras being everywhere. Now I understand the power of doxing and how it puts not only the subject in danger but their family aswell I believe it is the best kind of ultimatum to get these cops to admit their wrongs and be judged fairly by the law. This question was triggered by the specific case of This thread Upon further investigation of that case I found out that he was removed of his duty after the incident. I think seeing from the past thats where it would die but I am glad nowadays people are Doxing those cops and hopefully they will realize that the only way to have their own and their familys safety assured would be to willingly face jail time andor serious sanctions. On the other hand I know Doxing is wrong it just feels right in these cases.

I believe this divide is heading toward a turning point in the macrohistory of humanity. People have been moving toward a secularized society for centuries and in the past few decades it has reached a level where the most conservative and religious elements can no longer find enough common ground to coexist.

Each candidate represents an allegiance to a bundle of different policies which represents thousands of pages of documents which can represent years of reading and analysis. Understandably citizens are not allowed to vote on individual policies. The only alternative to an equal weight system is to weigh the votes differently.

This would be the effects Any attempt for the wealthy to reduce their taxes will result in destroying their own voting power. This is key and many people dont get this. The system is self correcting in that you cannot choose to not pay tax and also control the government at the same time. You would get a vote size proportional to your contribution to society. It seems rather fair that you should have a bigger say of what to do with the money if you contribute more. There is a high correlation between intelligence and income.

So I guess when people like Dillard talk about meaning in nature I put them into a mental category of people who refuse to accept their insignificance. It confuses me that they get praised so much for it especially when I know that the people doing the praising know what theyre talking about. ',\n 'TLDR In order for the American people to have a significant role with the current government and structure we would all have to become significantly more informed than we currently are. The American political system can be criticized on many levels. For example many feel that the Americas FPTP system is to blame as it reduces electoral competition as per Duvergers law. Others feel that a more powerful criticism is that singlemember districts allow legislators to engage in partisan gerrymandering diluting the voter strength of the opposition party. Some blame draconinan oter ID laws meant to disenfranchise certain demographic groups. Some blame Americas campaign finance system asserting that unrestricted donations from individuals and corporations corrupts the system and makes legislators beholden to their donors and backers rather than to their constituents. Some assert that the aforementioned problems are compounded by issues in the political economy neoliberal economic policies that allowed the rich to take a higher share of national income and wealth enabled them to game the political system in their favor. oreover many political scientists look at how governance is affected by both actors and institutions. The institutional design of the U.S. federal government necessities compromise however when the political parties are unwilling to work together as is the case now the gears of government grind to a halt. As per the conditional party government theory when the parties are internally homogeneous and polarized efficiency increases in the House due to positive and negative gatekeeping by the Speaker but efficiency is worsened in the Senate due to the filibuster unless one party has members. As a result during periods of divided government little gets done. Furthermore the constitutional design of the U.S. and the system of federalism could lead to political dysfunction. While all of these are arguably problems depending on your viewpoint I feel that above all else the main problem is a dangerously illinformed populace. ost voters dont have any meaningful knowledge of American history world history political theory knowing about the principles upon which America is based economics business science sociology foreign policy etc. Im not saying that its practical or expected for people to become experts in all of these fields but they need some basic knowledge so that they can think for themselves to some degree. oreover people dont spend enough time critically thinking about the various issues in politics both issues that affect them personally and issues that affect America at large and dont adequately analyze the positions of the candidates. Furthermore people are so illinformed that they fail to even apply basic mathematics to real world issues. As a result they fall for all sorts of hilariously misguided policies and mathematically impossible schemes. Theres a concept in politics called words which is if you cant simplify a policy issue in words or less your audience wont get it. ost issues are extremely complex involving multiple sides all with gains and losses and the majority of the audience are extremely incapable of truly grasping them. oters often use heuristics to determine their vote as a result the are easily manipulated by pundits whom voters believe to knowledgeable. Because of low information voters politicians have an incentive to pander the lowest common denominator and to appeal to peoples fears and emotions. onsequently voters dont choose the best candidate. They chooses the candidate who promises the most and best things regardless of whether the candidate can actually get these things done and uses flashy vacuous feelgood psuedoinspirational political rhetoric compare this to Britain where candidates focus more on concrete policy and use facts and figures in their debates. Politicians focus more on rhetoric appealing to pathos rather than formulating concrete policy to the nations problems. Since people are so vulnerable to manipulation politicians can convince voters to vote against their interests and make them genuinely believe lies including the belief that manmade climate change isnt a real thing and that cutting taxes on the very wealthy aka job creators will trickle down to the poorest worker. The reason why politicians care more about serving special interests is because politicians would rather impose diffuse costs on voters at large while providing specific benefits to politically engaged special interest groups RATHER than providing diffuse benefits to voters a politically disengaged group and providing specific costs to special interests. After all politicians can later delude their constituents into thinking that their evisceration of energy efficiency standards actually helps voters by creating more jobs or something. People often blame SuperPAS and the Koch brothers etc for rigging the electoral system. But ultimately what they are doing is airing ads sending leaflets disseminating their views on the internet doing marketing campaigns etc. Its not as if the Koch brothers are literally forcing the viewers of their ads to vote for particular candidates. oters still do have the final say in whom they vote for. If people became more genuinely educated and aware about these issues they would be able to think for themselves and would be better able to critique the positions of political candidates and resist the propaganda spewed by pundits and candidates and their campaigns. If people actually exercised their voting right in a meaningful manner politicians would be less beholden to special interests and would have an incentive to pursue policies actually in line with the genuine views of their constituents. oreover voters would pick higher quality candidates who instead of focusing all their time trying to fundraise from special interests and deluding voters would focus on legislating policy to deal with Americas genuine issues climate change education etc. ',\n 'TLDR In order for the American people to have a significant role with the current government and structure we would all have to become significantly more informed than we currently are.

Im aware there was a on this subject not too long ago However theres a few points I feel werent made there. Ill try to avoid treading over the same ground. For one my idea of an urban area is one where most amenities are in range of walking biking or a relatively short bus ride. This includes schools shops parks etc. This was brought up in the past AA but the discussion didnt really include a comparison of accessibility. ities can generally be navigated without a car because they usually preceded the car. Suburbs on the other hand were designed explicitly around cars the feasibility of walking wasnt taken into consideration by planners developers or business owners when placing public spaces and private businesses. This critical distinction means that while suburbs may have shops parks libraries and of course schools children are completely dependent on their parents for access. This is not conducive to raising kids with an independent mindset. Where the urban year old who wants to play soccer see his friends or buy an icecream cone can simply get up and go the suburban kid has to ask her parents who then have to agree to take time out of their day to drive her down. Furthermore the urban kid would get passive exercise if he walked or biked to where he was going the suburban kid rarely has that option for reasons of distance or safety. When she turns the suburban kid does have the option of getting a car. However this means thousands of dollars have to be dedicated to getting the independence and freedom that the urban kid has already had for years. The urban yearold is more likely to spend money from a job on something other than basic transportation. These criticisms also all apply to rural areas but those have one critical offset access to space. y childhood was spent between rural western Washington state and rural eastern Oregon. In both cases though my neighborhoods might have resembled suburbs there was a lot of undeveloped unfenced land around. y friends might have had to be dropped off by their parents but once they were there we went exploring in the woods or desert built forts rode bikes played war. When I got older we could play paintball. Other kids in the neighborhood rode dirt bikes. Though we didnt have access to ball fields or libraries in walking distance we did have the forest W Washington or desert E Oregon as a playground. Other rural kids that I have known have learned to build small structures raised livestock or learned target shooting. In short the design of the suburbs makes it almost impossible to get around without a car. This prevents children who grow up there from developing independent problemsolving abilities that their urban and rural peers will develop. They will be less likely to exercise because more barriers are thrown into their way. When they get to driving age they will most likely take a parttime job and dedicate most of its proceeds to getting the mobility their urban peers take for granted. Parents who choose a house in the suburbs over a house within city limits are saddling their children with dependence inactivity and expense. Please .

',\n 'I am extremely angered when I hear things like ichael Brown was executed. ops are not secretly serial killers who are just waiting for a chance to get away with killing someone. But thats how these morons are portraying the police. I refuse to believe that a member of the police performed a public execution under scrutiny of other bystanders. The cop isnt mentally ill. His actions must done alongside of some kind of self interest. Shoot an innocent person who poses no danger in the head execution style in public? Really? What possibly way of reasoning could lead to that conclusion? I was confident since the very break of the news that the cop was unlikely to have done anything wrong. These protesters automatically assumed the cop was in the wrong and refused to acknowledge new evidence. I get pissed off that people think ichael Brown is still a saint after the video of him robbing the store was released. Retards insist that it has nothing to do with the shooting. It has everything to do with it. The reality is that ichael probably thought he got caught and therefore his interactions with the cop was likely to be extremely aggressive. I imagine it went something like Officer Hey youre blocking traffic ichael I aint rob no store you fucking pig. Officer I didnt say... ichael These cigars aint from the store. Officer I didnt ask about.... ichael Fuck all ya. Always tryin a hold me down Officer Ok put your hands in the air! ichael Fly high or die tryin!! YOLO!! AHHH charges head first at cop and gets shot like a retard Seriously if the cop was a sick fuck and gets a boner shooting up black people he could have done so in a secluded area at night when no one was around. It would have been his word against the world no witnesses. Somebody please explain to me why people protesting in favor of this dead thief isnt a moron.

',\n 'First of all I want to clarify that I am arguing about universities that are paid for by the government most universities in the western world and public colleges in the states. Also I am referring to accepting money for scholarships not scholarships that were established in the past and are simply continuing to run on investments. Prior to the past or so years there was a massive gender gap in university. This gap was due to stigma against women and the status quo that existed at that time. Scholarships were very important to encourage females to attend university. Likewise racial minorities were greatly misrepresented. However I believe that now they are not only not needed but they provide an unfair bias towards specific people. In recent surveys in anada the US the UK and Australia there is an relatively equal ratio of male to female at universities with the average usually leaning towards male to female. In addition the increase in female intake results in an even bigger increase in the gap. Now there is still a gap between male and females in physical sciences maths and engineering ranging between relatively small malefemale to quite large . While this may be an issue I do not believe scholarships are a way to solve it as they have been continuously offered and yet the gap is increasing still in some cases. I believe that the way to solve it would be for a greater push for opportunities in high school perhaps. Similarly race is nowhere near the issue it was in the past. irtually all major universities are quite culturally diverse and wish to take in the best students regardless of race. In addition due to immigration in the past there are students who can gain major scholarships despite being quite removed from their racial background as an example I knew someone who got a major scholarship for being of Korean descent despite the fact that his parents left when they were young and he had never visited. All in all I believe it is discrimination that someone is restricted from certain financial aid for the sole reason of their birth. Receiving a scholarship no longer is due to being very good at what you do compared to everyone but rather only compared to people of a specific small group. Now it is possible that people of certain areas may have received less education or support but I believe aid for those people should be given based upon circumstance rather than gender or race. In addition such scholarships lead to confusion regarding certain parties for example is a intersex or a transgender person male or female? In the end I believe that such scholarships should be offered to everyone with equal opportunities. hanged views Realistic implementation As people have pointed out to me it is much harder to implement such a view without marginalizing minorities than I thought. I concede that though I may disagree with it on principle it is still near impossible to change in the near future. Imbalance in some locations Some people have pointed out that I have made some major assumptions and that there is still major racism and sexism in many locations. Perhaps as a nonAmerican in a very culturally diverse location I have a much different experience than most of Reddit I go to school where whites are the minority and work at a university that is Indian and Asian. I tried to do as much research as possible but obviously personal experience in this case is something I dont have. aintained views Ideological belief This is something that I feel has perhaps been reaffirmed by the constant statement that It might work in theory but never in practice. I still hold the belief that in a vacuum scholarships should be merit based and that they should be available for people of all race and sex. Belief that certain issues are better addressed through other means People have brought up that white males have an advantage in terms of opportunities that exceeds the few scholarships of race. Where I live I have never experienced that in fact in general the white population is actually poorer than many other races. However assuming in such a case I believe that aid should be given based upon economic situations rather than race. There can very well be white males in poor circumstances with limited education just like there can for anyone else. oney should not be donated to a sexistracist cause Not saying that this is one but some people have made the point that people should be able to do whatever they want with it. I disagree still and believe that it should not be allowed to support hateful causes. Notes First and foremost as mentioned above I am not American and this has led to some confusion on both parties. Laws seem to be different in the States than where I live we are not allowed to give money to racist sexist or hateful things. Similarly we do not have legacy or athletic scholarships and you cant get into university simply because you are rich. Some people have brought up that it is unfair to ban affirmative action and allow these scholarships. If it was my decision I would ban those as well and make scholarships completely need based or merit based independent of anything else. I am aware that the amount of scholarships available to people of race only is minimal this is more about the concept and belief rather than actual financial aid given out. In my experience it is not rare to have major scholarships available only to people of race where I live but like I said it may be different elsewhere. ost importantly I hope I am not coming across as racist or sexist. Often when these discussions come up people seem to take a very polarized opinion. While I do not agree with some views I can understand almost all of them. Personally I am someone who believes in equal opportunities for people of all races classes and sexes.

All in all I believe it is discrimination that someone is restricted from certain financial aid for the sole reason of their birth. Receiving a scholarship no longer is due to being very good at what you do compared to everyone but rather only compared to people of a specific small group. Now it is possible that people of certain areas may have received less education or support but I believe aid for those people should be given based upon circumstance rather than gender or race. In addition such scholarships lead to confusion regarding certain parties for example is a intersex or a transgender person male or female? In the end I believe that such scholarships should be offered to everyone with equal opportunities. hanged views Realistic implementation As people have pointed out to me it is much harder to implement such a view without marginalizing minorities than I thought. I concede that though I may disagree with it on principle it is still near impossible to change in the near future. Imbalance in some locations Some people have pointed out that I have made some major assumptions and that there is still major racism and sexism in many locations. Perhaps as a nonAmerican in a very culturally diverse location I have a much different experience than most of Reddit I go to school where whites are the minority and work at a university that is Indian and Asian. I tried to do as much research as possible but obviously personal experience in this case is something I dont have. aintained views Ideological belief This is something that I feel has perhaps been reaffirmed by the constant statement that It might work in theory but never in practice. I still hold the belief that in a vacuum scholarships should be merit based and that they should be available for people of all race and sex. Belief that certain issues are better addressed through other means People have brought up that white males have an advantage in terms of opportunities that exceeds the few scholarships of race. Where I live I have never experienced that in fact in general the white population is actually poorer than many other races. However assuming in such a case I believe that aid should be given based upon economic situations rather than race. There can very well be white males in poor circumstances with limited education just like there can for anyone else. oney should not be donated to a sexistracist cause Not saying that this is one but some people have made the point that people should be able to do whatever they want with it. I disagree still and believe that it should not be allowed to support hateful causes. Notes First and foremost as mentioned above I am not American and this has led to some confusion on both parties. Laws seem to be different in the States than where I live we are not allowed to give money to racist sexist or hateful things. Similarly we do not have legacy or athletic scholarships and you cant get into university simply because you are rich. Some people have brought up that it is unfair to ban affirmative action and allow these scholarships. If it was my decision I would ban those as well and make scholarships completely need based or merit based independent of anything else. I am aware that the amount of scholarships available to people of race only is minimal this is more about the concept and belief rather than actual financial aid given out. In my experience it is not rare to have major scholarships available only to people of race where I live but like I said it may be different elsewhere. ost importantly I hope I am not coming across as racist or sexist. Often when these discussions come up people seem to take a very polarized opinion. While I do not agree with some views I can understand almost all of them. Personally I am someone who believes in equal opportunities for people of all races classes and sexes. ',\n 'First off let me clarify I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the T footage of ichael Brown robbing a convenience store. Now that thats out of the way I dont really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the T footage showing what appears to be ichael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage appeared to cast aspersions on the dead man or is a form of character assassination.  Finding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street and a violent altercation took place soon after. I see family members and other people saying that he wasnt perfect but it seems to me that theyre dismissing the fact that he had just committed a crime. The police officer may not have known of ichael Browns actions but it makes sense that ichael Brown would be more onedge scared and impulsive after committing a crime and encountering a police officer so soon after. Thus this footage provides a critical perspective into ichael Browns state of mind and his subsequent mannerismsbehavior might have alerted Officer Wilson and escalated the encounter.  y view is that the T footage was essential information that needed to be provided to the public. While it may have been misconstrued as character assassination the footage is an invaluable part of the story that helps explain the context and actions of both Officer Wilson and ichael Brown. ',\n 'For every song with a positive message like Keep ya head up or hanges hes got more that glorify gang violence and shootings. The idea that he was nonviolent is totally at odds with the music he actually made. A brief glance at his wikipedia page will also show you that he was an exceptionally violent person He assaulted another rapper with a baseball bat in and assaulted a film director in . In both cases he plead guilty. He was also found guilty of gang raping a woman in a hotel a crime for which he was sent to prison. With anybody else those three crimes would be enough to judge someone as an extremely violent and unsafe person highly unsuited to be a role model for anybody but for some reason hes earned a reputation for being some kinda hiphop gandhi. There are plenty of legendary rappers like os Def Nas and Andre whose positive messages are overlooked in favour of Tupac despite managing to avoid assaulting or raping people. The fact that Tupac garners as much respect as he does is symptomatic of massive immaturity in certain parts of the hiphop community.',\n 'Okay lets clear some stuff up first.

Word count.',\n 'Note This is related to United States law but in theory it could apply to other places. I am specifically arguing this from a perspective of US law. There are various things that disqualify people from being allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition. These generally include sometimes depending on state being involuntarily committed to a mental institution being the target of a restraining order being adjudicated by a court to be mentally unfit to stand trial being convicted of a violent misdemeanor or a domestic violence crime and being convicted of a felony. ost people seem to be perfectly happy with prohibiting some people from possessing firearms based on their history convictions mental illness etc. I believe we should be very careful with who we remove constitutionally protected rights from but I am ok with removing firearm rights through due process of law in most of the cases where we do under current law. y question is why do we not remove the privilege of people to possess and consume alcohol under certain circumstances? This isnt a constitutionally protected right and removal of that freedom would be done with due process anyway so there is no particular reason why we cannot do it. We should create a list of offenses that disqualify a person from being allowed to possess or consume alcohol. That list should include people with a DUI conviction that resulted in injury or death to an innocent person with a felony DUI conviction multiple DUIs in a short period DUI while on a suspended license etc people with a domestic violence or child endangerment conviction that was alcohol related and perhaps even people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution with suicidal tendencies. Alcohol consumption seems to increase risk of suicide in people who are already very depressed or suicidal it seems to increase the likelihood of domestic violence and child abuse and it definitely increases the risk of DUI in people with prior DUI convictions. In fact I have a friend with DUIs over a period of less than years while driving on a suspended license and yet they still eventually gave him his license back and he still drinks regularly and sometimes drives while under the influence. I think that is appalling just because he hasnt hurt anyone yet doesnt mean he should be allowed to keep drinking and driving until someone gets killed. His ability to legally possess and consume alcohol is a danger to society and simply suspending his license again isnt good enough he will still drive illegally even without a license. Here is how I would implement it. I think it is too much of a burden to require all bars and liquor stores to call up a system and run a background check on every patron like the current NIS system for firearms. Instead I propose that people who are deemed to be prohibited persons should have a special mark placed on their drivers license or ID which would indicate that they are prohibited. Bar tenders and liquor store employees would need to check everyones ID not just people who appear to be under age and would be required to refuse to sell alcohol to anyone with that mark on their license. Obviously that wont stop them from paying a homeless person to buy them alcohol like teenagers do so we also need strict penalties for prohibited persons who are caught with any alcohol in their blood or in their possession and even stricter penalties if they are caught committing any sort of crime while under the influence such as DUI domestic violence etc. This post was prompted by this thread but has also been something Ive been thinking about for a long time TLDR Just like some people are deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess firearms due to criminal activity or mental illness some people potentially for different reasons should be deemed by society to be too irresponsible to be allowed to possess or consume alcohol and it should be a criminal offense for a prohibited person to possess or consume alcohol. ',\n 'Im not a fan of the way policy discussion takes place and feel it could be more productive. Let us start off with abortion. I am completely pro choice but I dont like the way discussion in some cases takes place. For example I saw a post on two x that didnt really refute any restrictive abortion policies but just stated the right to bodily autonomy as an argument against them. I dont feel like stating that is a proper refutation. I think that if we were to look at something like sex selective abortion policies it might be more obvious what I see is wrong with those arguments. Imagine if they were having a debate in India. One person brings up all this data about the problems with unrestricted sex selective abortion and the other person simply said that those policies shouldnt be allowed because it was their right to an abortion for whatever reason they wish. This would be bad because the discussion is far too nuanced. I think that there are problems that arise from hiding behind this argument. The fundamental reason I would consider it bad is this. Rights are a human construct. A bunch of people got together and decided that guaranteeing certain rights would be best for the people. It seems perfectly reasonable that they couldve been wrong and that guaranteeing those rights in certain situation are bad. Not trying to suggest whether or not they are. They could be though so arguing that something shouldnt happen because it is your right is a terrible argument. Im not trying to suggest all discussion that takes place is like this. When talking about gun rights there is a lot of fruitful and important discussion using data statistics and other relevant factors. However there is a small group of arguers who would refute arguments from the other side by simply saying that it is their right guaranteed by the second amendment. I think that rights are not relevant in policy discussion. ',\n 'Heres the thing. ore than once Ive had people who do one of two things. They either stay behind me and flash their lights to signal to me that they want me to move over or they just drive very close behind me till they just decide to get over themselves. Both of those situations have happened when I was going at or over the speed limit and when there was no other traffic besides us literally in one instance as well as when the traffic was busy and it wasnt quite so easy to merge. So tell me why should I have to move out of your way just because you cant be bothered to move the steering wheel slightly to the left or right? The burden should be on you to get around me since Im going at or above the speed limit. ',\n 'Whenever theres a news item about a female teacher getting charged for statutory rape with a male student inevitably theres a bunch of comments along the lines of Niiice I wish I could have had such a teacher. In response there are frequently comments like The boy wasnt able to consent so he was raped. I dont think itd be good for teachers to be free to have sex with students with no consequences. Im not advocating for the abolition of the age of consent. I accept that the power differential and the immaturity of the younger person makes it problematic at the very least. Yet all the same I think its a great false equivalency to consider it to be a similar magnitude offense to being held down and raped. The primary reason I believe this and admittedly its based on little more than intuition is that I feel that victims of the respective crimes tend to feel much differently in hindsight. From what Ive read forcible rape victims often find the experience highly traumatic and suffer longterm psychological problems. irtually all would agree that the experience was a huge negative. But I think if you were to poll a group of statutory rape victims years later when they were more mature you would get a much more diverse range of responses. Some would have no regrets and do the same thing over again some would regret it but chalk it up as a silly youthful mistake and others would blame it for a lot of their current problems. Probably the breakdown wouldnt look too different from polling them about any relationship theyd had while young. What would it take to change my view? Probably strong empirical evidence that statutory rape victims do by and large suffer significantly. I see that kind of thing asserted a lot but I kind of wonder if its a bit of justso story. He had sex with his teacher said years later that he didnt regret it but hes psychologically damaged so he doesnt know that he regrets it! ',\n 'Ive argued this to friends before and stand by it.

Lets say that they are let go from their jobs due to the fact that automation would be cheaper for business owners. We now have roughly million people out of jobs. Yup Id say that would put us in the very least a recession or possibly a depression. These million people would be unable to acquire the skills necessary to be hirable in the dwindling workforce due to a lack of money to receive an education.

When Tesla began to put pressure on regular auto dealers because of their superior product New Jersey Texas olorado Arizona and irginia all prohibited the sale of Teslas in their states. If those states will go to those measures to protect car dealers I would bet money that the Federal Government would do a good deal to protect the jobs of of the workforce. I simply dont think that automation will change our lives as radically as the folks at rfuturology would like you to believe. Sure automation will come into effect in the future but I dont think that it will be the problem that some have been making it out to be. So if you do believe this is a bigger issue than I do please . ',\n 'Often the word count on a viral blog postarticle is roughly equivalent to a chapter in a book which means with each of these articles you read at home work in between or during classes youre technically mowing through a novel. Even when youre on Facebook Twitter rAdviceAnimals etc. you are still reading. onsider the number of words even one image macro has. Then think about how many of them youve read today. I am willing to bet that of them will net you at least words. Now think of the character tweets you read today. How many words do you think fit within that limit? And what about your Facebook status updates YouTube video descriptions the comments sections on each of those your iPods song and album titles your text messages Reddit threads etc.? Well what about the literary value? Isnt Shakespeare more valuable than an inane tweet? Hamlet doesnt contain half the raw angst found on a teenagers Twitter page. Ive found more engaging and entertaining stories written in rfatpeoplestories. And where besides online literature forums and classes can you find people debating and discussing Hamlet? Yet nearly every single Reddit thread tweet racked.com article and image macro invites and incites disagreement between people over the intent and content of the post. Heres what it comes down to the internet is interpretable discussable and entertaining three qualities that are present and valued in classic literature. The only advantage a novel has over the internet is one continuous story uniting the discussion the themes and motifs everything. Unless every single page you browsed in one day was all about the same thing its unlikely youll have a truly equivalent experience but for the most part a good internet session is just like digging into your favorite book. ',\n 'I got this idea when I was struggling to find the way on a poorly lit path ten minutes after following an unlit trail without much difficulty and I cant stop thinking that the way we use street lights is not very well thought out. They typically use ineffective sodium vapor lights. While sodium vapor lights are highly efficient technically speaking they produce yellow or orangish light far outside of our eyes peak sensitivity which is in the bluegreen region. So despite their efficiency they need much more power to provide good visibility than many other sources of light like fluorescent tubes. Even when the lights are replaced with modern LED lights most places opt for higher brightness instead of reduced power consumption. They are usually bright enough to disable night vision yet often not consistently bright enough for good day vision. This often makes it harder to see than with no artificial lighting at all especially if there are large gaps between the lights. While the eyes readapt faster from such relatively low intensity light there is still a period of a few minutes when you are effectively blind. I would not be surprised if it was a major cause of accidents. any lampposts are designed and placed in such a way that its impossible to not look directly into the light which makes the above even worse. Instead if public lighting is to be provided at all it should be either cyan or white light limited to at most moonlight levels with possible exceptions for important signs and such and similar restrictions imposed on other sources of light like shop windows. It would consume much less energy less often. It would provide enough light for any activity that can be expected to be done outside at night with fully dark adapted vision and restricted vision before dark adaptation yet not enough light to break night vision. It would greatly reduce light pollution.

While I do not think it is the best for my mental health I do think it gives me a massive edge over others. I say this because when you compare yourself it allows you to see where you stand against others and can cue a desire to improve. Furthermore I think the argument of we are all unique people so why compare is a way to justify our desire not to work for the results. This view allows us to be content with our flaws and gives us the cue that we cant achieve those goals that others have achieved when. I honestly believe that if I stop comparing myself to people I will lose the edge in my career path music and will not be viewed as serious. Ultimately people who do not compare themselves are not being realistic and are hiding from reality. In the real world we are always compared against other people and this is how we grow against others. If I was to stop comparing myself then I would not be able to see where I stand in the real world and thus would have a distorted view of reality. Besides every compares each other anyway so why not do it to ourselves first to see where we already are.

',\n 'Ive often heard that there is a difference between listening to an audiobook and reading the physical copy of the book. In my own personal terms I dont have a lot of free time. When Im doing something that doesnt require a lot of concentration cleaning traveling Ill often listen to an audiobook. y mind is focused on the story but I am able to perform chores etc. Essentially what is the difference between a book you read and a book narrated to you? Its the same content by the same author. The main counterarguments I can imagine are The main difference between listening to an audiobook and reading it off the page is the narratorimages in your head as audiobooks are influenced by whomever is reading it. Audiobooks dont require the same level of concentration as reading a physical copy of the book does. This might lead people to miss details. ',\n 'In the past five years there have been countless revolutions and protests around the world. The Arab Spring Euromaiden and the Brazilian protests to name a few. Whether the general consensus viewed these protests as right or wrong the fact that these people stood up for what they believed in and fought the government head on putting both themselves and their families in danger is truly courageous and inspiring. When Edward Snowdens revelations came to the spotlight there was anger among many Americans. The media portrayed the NSA as a corrupt organization for due reason. But all of this anger and frustration turned into nothing. Time went by and American voices criticizing the NSA faded into the backdrop. To this day our own government is spying on us and yet we sit back and let it happen. I have lost faith that the American people will ever fight against the government to defend our freedoms like those who took part in the aforementioned protests did. Im not saying that there needs to be a violent revolt in America. All Im saying is that the American people would never rise up in a mass protest and defend their rights and freedoms. People seem to take freedom for granted and let the government get away with suppressing basic rights because they believe the government would never do anything to hurt the American people. I know this post is all over the place but I found my view hard to put into words. tldr The American people take freedom for granted and would never rise up in protest against the American government even when their rights are infringed upon. . ',\n 'Im all for helping those who are down on their luck and need a little extra assistance but that doesnt mean my tax money should pay for their drugs and them to create more mouths they cant afford to feed on their own. if people have money for drugs they dont need welfare. Same logic but in reverse for children. If you need to be on welfare because you cant afford food or housing then you should not be able to have children you wont be able to afford to feed and care for. Too many people in my area and Im sure across the country are living off welfare that was meant to be used as a temporary helping hand to get people on their feet. If you end up pregnant you either abort give it up for adoption or get taken off welfare. well after reading all your points I wish to change some of my viewpoint. I am all for the people who get fired or laid off being able to get assistance and I wouldnt want to see anyones kids actually taken away so for those who asked about working mothers losing there jobs no they should definitely be able to keep their children. same goes for if they are pregnant when they apply. my biggest problem with the welfare system is when I see families with kids a PS putting big stereos in their new cars still collecting welfare and living that way for years. things like unemployment you are suppose to be looking for a job using the money till you get one. if your testing positive for the harder drugs chances are your not going to get a job seeing as most jobs drug check now. Thanks to KevinWestern about of my viewpoint has changed. I still think they should have to pass drug tests occasionally because if they have money for illegal drugs they have money for basic living needs and shouldnt need assistance but its not the childrens fault and they shouldnt be punished or denied the chance to live because of their parents.',\n 'This is part view part prediction. So its certainly fallible and i hope to be proven wrong in the near future. Id like for IS to be destroyed but i think thats an unrealistic expectation. This is a decent look at IS. They are well integrated into the areas they have captured. They are not universally hated by the surrounding civilians. They are not treating all civilians like prisoners or slaves or hostages. They have plenty of members recruits and sympathizers across enormous amounts of land. y view is that ivilian Blending is an unstoppable strategy designed to survive intervention from nations like the U.S. No individual country that respects or is bound by international law can defeat this strategy. ivilian Blending When a militant or terrorist group embeds into a civilian population in order to protect themselves from formal military retaliation. With successful use of this tactic there is minimal distinction visual or otherwise between the militants and the civilian people and infrastructure. its all shared space. militants are often near children and innocent civilians and live within the cities among the people. Goal To become as indistinguishable as possible from the civilian population to minimize the effectiveness of airstrikes and long range attacks. Tactics Dont wear uniforms store weapons in civilian areas such as osques Hospitals Schools vital infrastructure etc. Use residential civilian infrastructure like apartment buildings for militant activity use mass local propaganda and law enforcement to keep the civilians from fleeing recruit willing civilian martyrs encourage civilians to hide and assist militants for money use the inevitable civilian deaths to recruit more militants from the local population etc. Outcome Accurate recon becomes incredibly difficult and highly susceptible to errors. High civilian to militant death toll is inevitable in all types of operations. ajor mistakes will also happen that result in mass civilian deaths. Extremely high value targets will be impossible to kill without killing innocent people in osques churches schools power plants water treatment plants and other vital infrastructure protected by international laws. This will leave the U.S. with very limited options... Option ontain them. Full victory is impossible without mass civilian deaths and breaking international laws. Let IS have what land they have already taken. Perhaps liberate small towns that overwhelmingly want to be liberated. ontain them and get into a prolonged conflicts along their borders. targeted airstrikes while we arm their neighbors to keep them from spreading. Option Fight them. Accept the civilian deaths. Eventually be stopped by the International community and accused of war crimes. The civilian blending tactic ensures that the international community will start to see warcrimes against civilians. Prolonged asymmetric warfare tends to makes the powerful side into the bad guy. The weak side just has to survive because it cant win. The US will kill innocent civilians in numerous ways by accident on purpose as acceptable losses and by killing the willing martyrs. Thats just war but it wont be accepted and the US will be condemned for each death deemed by the world as avoidable. There will be antiUS protests across the world. The media will begin to frame this as US vs innocent civilians. America will have to reexplain itself over and over. Why are you still there why isnt IS defeated yet? why did you bomb that school? Why is the civilian death count so high? Didnt we go in there to protect these people? But instead we bomb their kids?! The body count will be reported as IraqisSyrians dead mostly civilians US dead all soldiers. and people will discuss how evil the US is more and more every day. People will say If some invading force was on my land id shoot them too why is the US over there anyways? The civilian body count will be in the thousands or tens of thousands because this terrorist tactic works extremely well. People will quickly forget why the US is fighting in Iraq and accuse the US of indiscriminately targeting civilians. The US will be called on by the UN to explain why the civilian body count is so high. IS will wait patiently laughing its ass off because the big dumb animal fell into the trap AGAIN... The US will pull out because of the international and internal political pressure. IS will have an enormous recruiting tool from having survived a war against the US. Genocide land grabs sharia law ethnic cleansing suicide bombing assassinations kidnappings general violence and evil begins anew in Iraq and the US is called for to intervene. But maybe im wrong. aybe this is what brings peace to that region. But personally i think IS hasis going to win. ight as well redraw the maps. The US can temporarily force them into hiding at enormous cost to the US but there is no way to actually permanently defeat them without unacceptable brutality. ',\n 'I get that lazy parenting will always cause parents to place a crying child in front of a T. And that its not always a bad thing after ten nights of no sleep a parent cant be expected to make the best decisions. Except there should be better alternatives to just the shiny glowing box. y reason being is that I loved T as a kid. It was my favorite thing to wake up in the morning to go see cartoons. Do I remember any of those cartoons? A bit yes. But what I really vividly remember is commercials. Advertisements for companies and products that may not even exist now. This was clearly the goal of the advertisements but I believe that this technique should be used to teach children good things not ingrain worthless information in their brains for all eternity. y example as a kid of the s is that fucking Sears commercial. If you grew in my time you know exactly which commercial Im talking about. Thats a terrible terrible problem with our society. I cant remember where all states are I cant write out the national anthem I cant tell you the list of all our presidents but I can remember to call now. This commercial played so much through my childhood and the effect it has had on me is just taking up space in my brain. I will never shop at Sears. I have not shopped there ever. Sears has never earned a dime from me. But they are permanently part of my memories because of the number of times they played their shit commercial. I could have had so many useful things in place of that commercial as well as others. I could have been groomed to recall things that would have a positive effect on the world and not consumerism. Im glad Netflix exists. So change my view please because Im tired of hating advertising and television.',\n 'In the wake of Robin Williams death theres been a lot of discussion in the community about depression which I think is great. The more awareness for what it is the better. I have a few viewpoints on this subject that I would like to get out there because its been bothering me. Little background Ive never been clinically diagnosed Ill get to why later but for the first years of college something weird happened. I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly pounds over those years and I was failing all my classes. I wasnt even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them but it occupied my mind quite a bit. I wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasnt able to do any of that. Like I couldnt get myself to do what I know I needed to do. It pissed me off. I blamed myself for that and I still do. So heres where it gets interesting and heres where I hope some of you can shed light on this topic. This was almost years ago so Im forgetting exactly where the shift happened but the summer after my nd year I started reading a lot into Zen Buddhism and Stoicism and this OPLETELY changed my view on the world and my life. What I realized was that my thoughts are in my head obviously and that I can be in control of them. I realized that I was putting positives and negatives into certain situations when the situation is neutral by default. The big thing for me was realizing that the world isnt mean or nice its indifferent. It literally gives no fucking shits about any of us. So I think what happened to me was that I had an expectation of reality that was different from reality itself. I believe this caused my year downward spiral to a point where I was an utter failure friendless and alone. This was definitely a ramble but I hope it made some sense. Im at a point in my life now where Im having a hard time remembering EXATLY how I felt during that period but I definitely remember that I would sometimes cry in the shower and do other things of that nature. I was literally alone for days straight. I would just wake up and sit in my room the entire day. I would ask for extensions and still not be able to muster up any assignments. At the time I saw that as a character flaw and now I still see it as a character flaw. So does this mean that I see depression as a character flaw? I also learned that a lot of people go through similar bouts. aybe not quite as intense rarely quite so intense...to the point where it is affecting your future but definitely something noticeable. So if I can get through it with reading books and changing my mental attitude why cant everyone else? Why cant we all realize that life isnt fun and games that its indifferent. Our thoughts AN be controlled. I couldnt control them before but now I can. Its not an overnight process it took me about years to go from that fateful summer of meditation and Stoicism to where I am now. Im at a point now where I can objectively evaluate the things that are going on in my life and even if theyre bad I can handle it. So instead of popping pills and getting electric therapy why dont we medicate people with depression with books and meditation and a ENTAL SHIFT instead of a chemicallyinduced whateverapillis? BTW this same thing applies to anxiety. I went from having crippling anxiety to...still having crippling anxiety but its gotten better. I went from not being able to hold a conversation without panicking sweating almost crying to being able to hold conversations for as long as necessary. Again this all happened without meds. This happened with a mental shift that I induced through books and meditation. I guess Im wondering if someone can explain to me why the goto method is popping pills and therapy when I know for a fact that you can bootstrap your own healing? Im not saying to man up or buck up Im saying to realize that its all in your head and that you dont have to be a slave to it. editation and selfhelp books helped me with that a lot. TLDR Pills are unnecessary for depression and anxiety. Theyre just character flaws that can be changed with practice. Obviously this doesnt apply to the fringe cases like Robin Williams or others who commit suicide but definitely applies to the majority of people who claim theyre depressed or anxious.',\n 'Humans evolved in the sun. There is no other animal on the planet that needs to wear sunscreen and people have been living in Africa without sunscreen or clothing for hundreds of thousands of years. Yes I know ever since we punched a hole in the ozone layer its gotten a lot more intense and Im not saying not to be careful. Obviously if youve been laying in the scorching heat for ten hours theres going to be a problem. I just think that articles like this that basically say if your kid ever goes outside without sunscreen theyll die of cancer amount to nothing more than sensationalism and fear mongering.

',\n 'In the most recent Ninja Turtles movie theres a scene where one of the main villains has one of his henchmen a Foot lan soldier killed to prove the efficacy of a weapon while being held down by two other Foot lan soldiers. Darth ader is also guilty of this routinely killing Imperial officers. So does the Joker in the Dark Knight and this actually almost goes wrong for him. All three of these examples represent slightly different reasons for killing your henchmen but I think each one is poor form. In the case of the Ninja Turtles villain actions like that engender dissent and create a culture of fear and paranoia among your henchmen. I mean those guys just had to hold down their coworker and watch him die how do they know its not going to be them next time? If anything would inspire me to quit or revolt that would definitely be up there. In the case of Darth ader he kills Imperial officers for failing him which stifles creativity and likely costs him a lot of high quality officers. The Empire is fighting an insurgency and as recent events in Afghanistan showed mistakes are going to be made and its difficult work. I suspect that the reason ader is constantly saddled with incompetent officers is that he killed all the competent ones long ago and now no one wants to work with him. Also the Empire clearly doesnt promote based on merit because ader immediately promotes a guy after the first time we see him kill someone and that guy sucked just as much. In the case of the Joker his plan almost backfires as its happening. You think when the Joker gets back to his Jokerave none of his countless other henchmen are going to be like Hey wheres inny and Don and Jake? Didnt they go to rob that bank with you? The Joker treats all of his henchmen as completely disposable and useless which is likely how he sees them but thats bad for morale. Its not like theres a shortage of villains hiring random thugs for stuff in Gotham. Go seek a job where your employer isnt a constant source of danger. achiavelli said that if you cant be loved and feared its better to be feared but he touted esare Borgia as a great leader and that guy died naked and alone of a stab wound. The only case where I think killing your henchmen makes sense is shooting deserters in the middle of a pitched battle as that encourages continued fighting in the moment over desertion in an over the top kinda situation. Otherwise its bad for business and lowers morale. There are better ways to handle all these situations. ',\n 'This is my first post on Reddit ever. I just found this subreddit tonight as I was thinking about a lot of opinion topics so I thought it would be a good time to express this opinion of mine. Disclaimer Im neither a vegan nor a vegetarian. I understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and dont really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meateaters dont actively kill the animals themselves by eating them they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian. This same philosophy compels people to vote in democratic governments. Even if they are only one person it takes many individuals to come together to elect representatives. This is the most valid argument that I can think of in favor of moral vegetarianism. This philosophy is all fine and good but vegetarians alone will not and cannot fulfill this goal by virtue of not being vegans. As long as dairy products and eggs are consumed there is still a need for dairy cows and egglaying chickens. When the cows no longer produce milk and the chickens no longer lay eggs what do you think happens to them? Generally they are turned into meat for human consumption. egetarians drink milk and eat cheese that comes from cows that get slaughtered. The only way to lessen meat production is to reduce the number of people with any kind of need or want for animal products. aybe Im wrong about what vegetarians aim to accomplish exactly. Any ideas?

Here are a few of the things that I think it would improve. Increased voter turnout as some people may not have someone to vote for but may have someone they absolutely do not want to win. It would make third party candidates chances at winning more viable. People would feel like they can be more engaged without selling themselves short by feeling the need to support someone who is of the same political party but a subpar candidate. It would allow for a whole new analysis of the political spectrum we have once we start seeing polls reflecting this new voting method. I honestly cant think of one negative implication of this idea becoming a reality.

As the title says I think that the majority of people who declare their sadness for the death of a celebrity are attention seeking simply wanting to jump on the band wagon or irrationally upset. Whilst I accept that people may have been inspired by works that the celebrity has done or feel they can relate to some of their work I do not accept that the emotional outpouring is genuine such as with the current Robin Williams situation and ichael Jackson. People who are genuinely distraught about celebrities theyve never met are likely to be either overly attached or overly involved with that celebrity. I obviously see nothing wrong with expressing sadness that they have passed or concerns for their family but as a generalisation the outpouring of emotion is ridiculous and fake. hange my view!

',\n 'In the past I have tried to start reading comic books but I find a certain hurdle that prevents me from really delving into the medium the price. While three or four dollars is not much money on its own the entertainment value of the product in my experience not worth the amount I pay. Ill use an example. Recently I bought the first issue of the new s. arvel series at .. In it there were pages of story and it took me about minutes maybe to read through the whole book. There were about four scenes in the book the store the house the party and Kamala gaining her powers all of which served to introduce Kamala but little else. While the narrative was entertaining it stopped the moment it began to develop leaving a hook for the reader to dish out an additional three dollars to further the story. onversely a film ticket may cost about three times as much about seventen dollars depending on where and when you buy the ticket but for that price youre getting at least an hour and a half of entertainment with a full three act story. A book can cost between five to twenty dollars but for that price youre getting at least several hours worth of entertainment. Ive read other comics and I can usually finish an issue in about minutes. To me paying three or four dollars for about ten minutes of entertainment is not worth it.

Why I see this as a double standard is because same kind of seduction songs performed by women have never been considered sexist even thought the message may be exactly the same.

It was generally used to dismiss why someone who is generally seen as a really genuine guy who gets the butt end of the stick. The honest man gets peace of mind the dishonest man gets ahead. Lately terming yourself the nice guy gets you a lot of flak because some how its been attributed an extremely negative connotation. The connotation Im describing is the belief that people who are nice are only doing so because of their ultimate ulterior motive to lay with anyone they are nice to. It assumes that their actions are purely manipulative and that they expect an actionreward sort of relationship out of people. I think this is a rude oversimplification of nice guys. In actuality these people just have a faith in peoples integrity. They are the ones that are sure to be quick and helpful about repaying a favor when someone does them a kindness. These people arent morons thoughthey dont assume sexual attraction to be a favor as popculture would tell you. The issue at play is that they are not exactly socially wellrounded so when they become involved with a girl in a platonic manner emotional attachment comes easily and quickly. This attachment only grows as the girl sees them as a closer friend because of how much time they spend together and how many favors the guy is willing to perform for them the notorious such a great friend line. eanwhile because of the nature of attraction the mans constant desire to please is sure to seat him in the also highly stigmatized friendzone. So the situation that arises is the man unawares finds himself with a woman whom he thought a strong bond of companionship and mutual feelings was blossoming when in fact she has not the slightest romantic interest in him. The man isnt expecting to hit a favor quota and receive the adoration of his adoredhe is simply deluded into the idea that the more time he spends with her the more she will realize or have the chance to realize that he is the one she has truly loved all along. Generalizing him as an asshole who is only interested in women for sex wont help him shake his fairy tale mindset. People assume he only had sexual interests from the start which I dont believe is true. They then instantly shame him for even having those interests which only furthers the problem. So reddit change my view tldr nice guys are confused or naive individuals that need a wake up call not conniving manipulating assholes that deserve to be ostracized.

I also understand that doing YouTube is still entertainment and is no different than going to the movies or watching a comedian and I feel that many should get compensated for their work. But I dont think people should make enough to live off of YouTube the reason being is because money corrupts. I recently discovered an interesting Youtuber who I wont name. His content is somewhat interesting and he seems like a genuinely nice and downtoearth person. He only has about subs the last time I checked but hes already opened up a merch store and has a nickname for his fanbase. A while back his recording equipment broke so he opened up a paypal donation thing and made a video to try to get people to donate. Not to mention the kickstarter he launched earlier and the many times hes mentioned wanting to make a living off of YouTube. Its apparent that this person is very focused on making profits off his videos. This person is just one example of what I assume are countless others who are like this though I am also aware there exists YouTubers that dont put much thought into money. I truly believe that you need a degree of knowledge charm and responsibility to succeed in YouTube and as such requires effort and talent to do unlike what many say. But it is undeniable that a large portion of YouTubers dont put the same amount of effort in their videos than what theyre worth. This encourages people to start YouTube because they think they can make easy money off of it not because they truly enjoy it. This just spells disaster since if youre reason for doing something is for money and not for enjoyment it will eventually get boring. And if youve already set your livelihood for YouTube its unlikely that you can quit or at least miss the dough you used to make. These are just a few examples I could think on the top off my head.

It would be lucrative for media companies that televise sporting events because they would be displaying a higher level of competition. any top athletes were already top athletes before they even took PEDs Barry Bonds Lance Armstrong meaning that steroids by no means replace natural talent. Im currently in college and I know many high school athletes that use PEDs and it is even more prevalent in college so if you believe this is a problem it is certainly not being solved by policing only the upper echelons of sports.

Fine lets assume that to be the case. It is nevertheless unclear how God is obviated of moral responsibility even if we concede this to be the case because hesheit is omniscient. If God is omniscient then it knew the exact actions that humans would take. If God knew the only outcome its actions would produce creating the world and humans and then human disobedience it follows that it is responsible for what it willed into being. If I know that taking action x creating the world and humans will result in outcome y human disobedience I must naturally take responsibility when y occurs as a result of x instead of say z human obedience The conclusion? God by virtue of omniscience must be responsible for human disobedience and he must have willed it.',\n 'I was thinking about this today since I was approched by a beggar that looked like he really needed it. I dont give money to beggars on principle I dont believe it helps them and it sure as help doesnt help anyone else. Instead I thought of the idea of giving them work. E.g. if youre sitting on a bench and there is a lot of litter around you ask them to clean the area for . If they do it you benefit because its cleaner around you. People benefit as well because the area is cleaner. The beggar benefits because they get both money and a life lesson hopefully. It may be that they will try to use that in the future and try to make small deeds for money instead of straight up asking for it. I know its far fetched but its better than just reinforcing the idea that all they have to do is say give me money to enough people to get by. If the person goes for it everybody wins. And if they wont accept it then its not your problem. for minutes of work is a great deal and people actually work by cleaning the streets for less than that. It may get to them in time when theyll be missing the or it may not. Either way I think the offer is fair and if you dont take it and prefer to beg instead you dont deserve a cent from anyone. I also think its more respectable to work for the even if its just collecting litter than just begging for it. I dont remember who said it but theres a millionaire that doesnt give money to any charity because he considers the idea of handing people money insulting to the people. Instead he invests in places that create a lot of noskill required jobs so people who want to work can do it.

Furthermore I believe the use of the word evil when referring to one or ones actions is toxic to public perception of psychology and morals. The most heinous terrible selfish disgusting acts that a person can commit can always in my experience be considered critically and be shown to have more practical roots than the overarching massive title of calling them or their actions evil.

Ive never really understood why people choose to get drunk when getting drunk can lead to some very stupid regrettable decisions.

However thats almost always followed up with a quick look into the artists other works. Too often all I see is more fan art. I have nothing against fan art as an idea. People like something so they take time to draw it or learn to play music from it or whatever other kind of tribute they can make. And dont get me wrong they usually do a really kick ass job at whatever theyre making. But its really depressing on a level because many of them could be making kick ass original art. And it seems that many people who would go out and become the next great artists or musicians are content to just make fan art.

',\n 'In order for democracy to work we put faith in the people. We believe that the majority of people will be able to successfully elect a government that represents their people. I believe that democracy has been sustainable in the United States because the majority of people were smart enough to elect leaders who had the best interests of the people and the country. However looking at birth rates demographics education levels income levels and so on... its becoming more amp more clear that the majority will soon become uneducated people. Let me be clear here by uneducated I mean people who cannot understand what is actually best for them and the country. If democracy continues to exist there is no defense against dumb people electing leadership that will ruin the country. These dumb people will have a greater say then the smart people and as a result will eventually cause the demise of democracy. Take Gaza for example. Hamas was democratically elected. Now to a levelheaded person they probably wouldnt want to elect a political party that is willing to sacrifice its own people to fulfill a political agenda. However in Gaza the majority of the people voted for Hamas and as a result they were elected. To me this is an example of democracy failing. When leadership that destroys its country is elected by a majority of people who believe said leadership is best for them simply because they are not educated or wise enough to understand the consequences of the leadership that they elected. This is just one example. I believe that in order for society to evolveexist we cannot put our faith in the people. I believe that we must be ruled by the elites of our societies. These elites are not selected by the people but are established based on certain merits. erits that are achieved through Humanitarian work educational work military work.. ect. Sort of like the Supreme ourt but without the appointment by a president. The appointment shall be made by qualifications that limit the representation to a handful of people. To me this is the only way to protect people from themselves. If you believe that Democracy wont fail I ask what makes you believe that there will be enough smart people to outweigh the dumb people? Using statistics of birth rates education levels amp income levels wouldnt you agree that lower society is the one reproducing at higher rates? Possibly because they arent bright enough to understand the financial personal amp physical burdens having many kids cause. Wouldnt you feel more comfortable putting your faith in the hands of honest educated competent people then a majority that is lacking most of those things? I say Democracy is doomed and its becoming clearer by the day. hange y iew ',\n 'I go to the movies a lot and it seems to happen pretty often that when the film finishes people in the audience will clap.

',\n 'I think investing in nuclear energy is one of the most foolish things that mankind has ever done. The sheer amount of energy it yields is certainly enticing but I do not think it is worth the risks it entails. y primary reason for despising nuclear energy is that in the event of a failure at a nuclear facility the results are catastrophic. any people claim that nuclear power plants are safeguarded with redundant forms of security making a meltdown impossible. I do not buy it. No matter how many safety regulations are implemented I think nuclear meltdowns are inevitable. These facilities are run by two things people and computers. People even highly trained people are fallible and I have used computers for far too long to trust that these computers are error proof. Whats more we have historic precedents of nuclear meltdown and the natural turned nuclear disaster in Japan to show us just how naive it is to think that nuclear energy is safe. When a hydroelectric power plant goes out people lose power for a while. Huge inconvenience for a lot of people possibly even a bit destructive but ultimately not a huge deal. When a nuclear power plant has a meltdown the entire area must be evacuated peoples lives are put in danger and the environment is polluted with radioactivity for over a century. Nuclear power plants are a threat to the communities they reside in and every nation ought to begin taking steps towards shutting down such facilities.

When he reinvents himself the only way he knows how to create a public identity is through branding thats why all of Batmans gadgets are so heavily batthemed and in the earlier versions of Batman even had a Bat prefix. Throughout the history of Batman the hero has refused to kill the villain and instead has him institutionalized or put in jail from which the villain the Joker Scarecrow etc. inevitably escapes and returns to terrorize the city again giving Batman an excuse to continue fighting crime. Everybody thinks Batman is really cool but I think its horrible because Batman is a symbol for corporate America bombarding us with hypercharged caricatures of our culture and selling it to us as their brand. When we root for Batman we root for that mentality. Somebody explain to me why I should see Batman as a role model like so many people do. ',\n 'Hello fellow redditors! Im Grim and heres your chance to tell me why Im an idiot and yadda yadda yadda. Heres the deal Im a year old White ale living in the state of Indiana in the United States of America. y first presidential election was in and I voted for Obama. Id already written off the Republicans as the slaves of corporate lobbyists private interests and hristian Fundamentalism and I still believe theres not a single republican worth my support in any way shape or form. I was one of those idealistic optimistic young voters who honestly believed in the power of Democracy. I bought Obamas falseHope hook line and sinker and aside from that I didnt see any alternatives to him that were even remotely palatable. Romney and Santorum were both about as razy fundy as presidential candidates got and Gingrich had Wallstreet so far up his ass that putting him in office wouldve been in my opinion only slightly less worse of an idea than electing Adolf Hitler. So here I was One vote to cast only one option that seemed viable. I put my faith my trust my hope in Obama and he fucked me. He fucked all of us. Gitmo is still open. The wars in the iddle East are still on. In some states homosexuals still have to be afraid of being true to themselves. The rich keep getting richer and those of us below the poverty line just keep sinking deeper and deeper into the mud. In short I realize now that voting for Obama was a waste of my time and energy and a huge blow to my ability to trust the American Political System. So what do I believe in? Well I like to keep it simple I believe in an end to the Drug War because its been a complete and utter failure and a waste of everyones time energy and money. I believe in an end to our participation in the iddle East conflicts because again we have achieved nothing One dead dictator thousands of dead civilians a secret prison full of accused terrorists who if they werent terrorists going in I could hardly blame them for being terrorists ifwhen they get out. Our soldiers deserve causes worth fighting for Not Imperial onquest and certainly not a war that does nothing but line the pockets of the ilitary Industrial omplex. I believe in reasonable restrictions on gun ownership but never an outright ban on handguns shotguns rifles etc. I believe that its not the governments business nor anyone elses who you love and who you marry. I believe in the complete and utter separation of church and state. I believe that if corporations and business arent going to pay their employees a fair wage then a minimum wage Thats a whole other must be set that is enough for people to get by on without having to resort to working three jobs. if cDonalds can triple the pay of their EO to . million dollars then I can call bullshit on a raise in the inimum Wage destroying the economy! I believe that education is a universal right for all humans and it shouldnt be denied to someone just because they cant afford it. I believe that limate hange being caused by humanitys rising consumption of fossil fuels and I want to see the government take an active role in shifting us away from their use while funding and supporting alternative energies. I believe in spending our budget responsibly and working to make a better country in the long term so that its a country Id actually want to start a family in. I dont like either party. Neither of them are anywhere near my stance in politics and I dont know where to begin looking for alternatives if they even exist. Im sick of watching the American People elect morons and greedy self serving jacknozzles and I cant allow myself to be a part of that endless circlejerk anymore. So heres the TLDR Given the disgustingly revolting state of the American Political Scene should I even bother voting? If so then provide me with some pointers for where to look for good candidates. Im looking for parties outside of the ludicrous Red vs Blue Spectrum. I still want to believe that the system can work. So help it prove itself to me.

If I tip the server benefits by the extra cash. If I dont tip they will at least get minimum wage as required by law. Life might be harder with minimum wage but people can certainly survive especially if they make good financial decisions like youre supposed to. Serving food to customers is part of the servers job description and Im not required to tip other minimum wage workers following their job descriptions for providing their time and service. An example would be noncommissioned sales associates in stores. I used to work at Best Buy for hour not exactly minimum wage but pretty close to it and I personally know how much time we can spend per customer. ost interactions usually last about min or less but its not that uncommon to be with a customer for up to a hour or more in rare cases. Even then sales arent guaranteed unlike a restaurant server. Over time price of meals might go up but I why should I care about that? Ultimately theres not a significant difference if a meal is cheap and I tip vs a more expensive meal but I dont tip? You might also argue that employers might fire servers who dont get enough tips as a sign of bad service but I dont think that should be the case. If a server is providing excellent service Im more likely to spend more like with dessert or drinks. If Im getting bad service I just want to leave as soon as possible resulting in less sale. Even if this system of evaluating servers doesnt work for whatever reason employers could always evaluate based on customer surveys or by sending out undercover people to eat at their restaurant.

In college it was practically currency. In my mid s I began to appreciate different kinds of flour the many methods of cooking it. I love me some pizza. When I hear somebody willing to forego the few seconds it would take to even just microwave it slightly or few minutes in a toaster oven I actually wonder why this person is putting such terribly unhealthy food into their body while getting such little enjoyment from it. Here is my logic for arriving at my contention The temperature of any food or beverage has significant impact on its flavor texture aroma and overall quality. There is a reason why fine wines and champagne have ideal serving temperatures. Pizza contains many oils mostly from cheese that are more present and aromatic when warm. The texture is significantly better when warm the crust is flakier but still soft the cheese is melted and more flavorful. It was cooked and meant to be consumed hot immediately. I dont know of any chef or restaurant that takes it from the oven to the cooler for it to reach its optimal quality before serving. Therefore warmhot pizza will always be better than cold pizza and spending even seconds in a microwave will make the enjoyment increase several orders in magnitude. If you disagree with this I posit you a are lazy b have poor taste in pizza c have great taste in quiche d all of the above. ',\n 'ute is a great word for cats dogs or a bow on a baby. It belongs to the small smile inducing things in life. I believe its become a catchall word used by people who cant describe what they see effectively and would rather beat around the bush. Thats not my point though. any of us guys spend our entire natural born lives to be anything but cute. We put razors around our neck each morning take the hard way and strive to be more rational and less provoked by emotions. ost guys dont look good. Thats OK.

I understand that The anliest an doing something cute for a girl is cute but then the action of the man is cute not the man. aybe Im overblowing this and its been a while since Ive been called cute. But I will say that each time it seriously feels like a small slap in the face to everything that Ive been driving for. I want to be a better man and I feel like calling me cute calls into question everything that Ive done up to this point. Im sure there are words like this for women as well. I havent talked to many people about this but one girl who kept calling me cute. Needless to say we dont speak much anymore. Id like to be OK with it but I havent been able to rationalize it. ',\n 'The biggest issue I have with games like Pokemon is an issue I have with practically every turnbased RPG level grinding. ant beat the boss? Fight the same enemy times and you can. ant beat these enemies? Go a few screens back and fight the enemies there times until youre strong enough to proceed. ost RPGs can get away with this by having some major strategy in the battle system or wonderful storytelling. The closest thing Pokemon has to this is its type weaknesses most of which are obvious Fire is weak to water. Even the ones that arent obvious can only be discovered by trial and error and still dont add a huge amount of strategy to the game. Imagine a new player about to reach Giovanni for the first time in the last gym. Oh the next boss uses ground Pokemon? Let me just throw everything at it until I see what theyre weak to. Water and grass? Let me fight the same Pokemon times until Im strong enough to fight them and win. The best case scenario without grinding is to hope the RNG is on your side which still seems like incredibly boring gameplay. Granted mikalaranda already changed my view so soon so unless you have something new to add I suggest you look at his response. It was perfect I think. ',\n 'I am a huge fan of Skyrims civil war storyline because both sides are somewhat morally ambiguous leaving it to each player to determine which side is worth joining. I wish to argue that when one looks at the situation as a whole the Imperial Legion is objectively the lighter shade of grey. Admittedly I have had a proImperial bias since before I first started playing Skyrim. Based on my experiences in both orrowind especially so and Oblivion the yrodiilic Empire has always seemed like a very nice place to be and so Ive always been an Imperial loyalist. I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option. But now after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides Im even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons. . A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also the Empire is generally good for Skyrim. This should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire then High Rock would be cut off from yrodiil and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire and whatever is left of orrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of t. vardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. EDIT Argonia was actually kicked out of orrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran. In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal. Of course a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out and dont forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort. But if they cannot have that Im sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course for any of those who actually like the Dominion this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks. There is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south and in exchange yrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel. . Ulfrics killing of King Toryyg sets a dangerous precedent. As Uncle Alvor put it Ulfrics claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to might begets right. Well no kidding thats how rebellions work some of you might be saying. But Ulfrics point in killing the king was that leadership comes from individual martial prowess. No king who cannot beat challengers in single combat is fit to rule. Such an attitude does not belong in any civilized society because it is hazardous to stability. Whats to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesnt like Ulfrics successor? It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it and if he had agreed then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did Im convinced that Ulfrics rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg. There are other points to be made about the Great War the WhiteGold oncordat the release of Hammerfell and the arkarth Incident but Ill address those if they come up.

Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south and in exchange yrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel. . Ulfrics killing of King Toryyg sets a dangerous precedent. As Uncle Alvor put it Ulfrics claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to might begets right. Well no kidding thats how rebellions work some of you might be saying. But Ulfrics point in killing the king was that leadership comes from individual martial prowess. No king who cannot beat challengers in single combat is fit to rule. Such an attitude does not belong in any civilized society because it is hazardous to stability. Whats to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesnt like Ulfrics successor? It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it and if he had agreed then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did Im convinced that Ulfrics rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg. There are other points to be made about the Great War the WhiteGold oncordat the release of Hammerfell and the arkarth Incident but Ill address those if they come up.

I know that she always wanted more then one child and we agreed upon this before her pregnancy. I dont know whether she would leave me over that matter. If i take a quick look at the propability of a second child having this disorder as well its . If our second child were to be a daughter she most likely never could have kids on her own due to ovarian damage received while still in the womb. For other not really understood reasons females usually are more likely to suffer all the issues mentioned above in a more severe form. I dont think we should take the risk.

Forgive me for saying but does reaching the arbitrary number of and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant? Is it just as a way to say thanks? Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base. Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security medicare and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation. There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value to the table that are tough but dont get discounts. What about farmers? They feed us right? Doctors? They keep us healthy. Scientists? Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives.',\n 'Outside of academia where generally if someone says its art for the sake of discussion its treated as art there is considerable debate about what counts as art and what doesnt. Well maybe just on reddit. But often I feel it would be helpful to have a clear and reliable definition of what counts as art so the discussion could move forward. This also addresses a common opinion that boils down to I dont like it therefore it is not art. Anyway heres my definition of art Any form of communication with at least one layer of abstraction. edit removed word attempted Here is why I think this works. Its mediumagnostic so it can apply equally well to any type of art including spoken word performance sculpture whatever. Its nonnormative meaning we dont have to consider whether the artist did a good job or had any particular purpose. It boils down to Was there communication? even unintentional? And Was the communication abstracted in some way? By this I mean the full content isnt just explicitly stated. Examples of what is not art A stop sign is not art. Its communication you stop here but the message is not really abstracted. A random splotch of oil on the ground that looks really awesome is not art because it wasnt produced by a person to communicate anything. Jackson Pollocks work is art because there is communication about his thoughts feelings and art itself in there although it is heavily abstracted. Difficultiesobjections Indeed for example stylization of text could be considered abstracted communication. I think this is OK. Design can be considered a type of art. Yes I guess it does. BONUS ROUND y definition of Good Art which I realize is too subjective to debate meaningfully but Im throwing it in here anyway Good art helps ones fellow humans understand better. Here understand means understanding themselves others the world around them life culture etc. It is orthogonal here to the idea of knowledge in the sense of information that hasnt been emotionally integrated into ones worldview or mindset. I like this definition because it encompasses just about all art thats considered great while allowing us to reject art thats superficially wellexecuted or conceptually interesting but ultimately worthless to the human experience. For example Star Wars fan art is usually not good art. Imitative contemporary abstract nonsense is often not good art. But maybe Jeff Koons can be considered good art again? In this light Duchamps Fountain and alevichs black squares can be more important to me anyway than ... say... onet. Interesting! Okay thats it! What do you think is there a more useful definition of art we can use? How about good art? ',\n 'Every time I see the news whether it be NN Fox or BB I see in the headlines ISRAEL BOBS GAZA WONT STOP DESPITE KILLING IILIANS. I see the number of casualties to both sides and things just dont add up. I think it is possible that the Palestinians are taking up military strongholds in public compounds such as schools and hospitals taking hostages which could help account for the number of civilian casualties and minimizing their military casualties by allowing the Israelis to destroy these compounds while under the impression that there are more soldiers there. What the world sees is the Israelis bombing the shit out of a bunch of helpless civilians resulting in genocide. The end result is propaganda against a UN affiliated nation that is mercilessly committing genocide against a smaller helpless nation despite all of the tension between these two nations that led up to this. ',\n 'Farmers have no incentive to make good tasting nutritional tomatoes. They go bad quicker and are more difficult to grow. A farmer instead has incentive to make tomatoes that last longer and can be grown year round. aking more beneficial tomatoes for society is asking farmers to sacrifice profits. The meat industry has no incentive to find more ethically reasonable systems of working. It would be a massive cut in their profits considering their current system is strictly based on efficiency and volume of product. Batteries that never die? Tires that never lose tread? Whats the incentive? If you didnt have to buy new batteries you would only spend your money one time. The cut in profits would be massive. Newspapers news stations and other media outlets answer to someone at the top of their financial food chain. Those people more often than not care about the bottom line. How many papers are we selling? how many viewers are we getting? This directly interferes with the quality of the journalism being presented by these outlets. The medical industry has a tragic lack of incentive to be as efficient as possible for the reasons already outlined above. But this issue cuts us down to even much more trivial issues When someone makes a movie based on a comic book or other intellectual property... they had the idea to do so due to the massive popularity of the source material. However... all of the movies we get inspired by this source material is reinvented and redesigned... this is to make them as middle of the road as possible so that grandma your little sister your parents and you can all potentially go see the movie. They want that bottom line the most sales. This is the primary motivation to the metaphorical raping of s and s nostalgic culture IE transformers gi joe etc. ... they see something that could get a lot of people to go to the movie theater... wipe their ass with it and move on. It doesnt matter if they do justice to the source material.. .they just need those ticket sales. The music industry has no incentive to promote quality music. Nickleback and Soulja Boi are a dime a dozen... there is a billion of them in every city. Radiohead and F Doom are uncommon artistic talents... Artists have demands they want their work to be seen a certain way. They are difficult to work with because they dont care how much money you make by representing them their art comes first. If you can find any rapper or townyrock band promote the crap out of them and oversaturate the masses to a premeditated formula of music you cut out your necessity to rely on artists for their art. This is all in the name of your bottom line becoming fatter. The examples I could outline are almost inexhaustible. onetary profit motivation especially capitalism makes it next to impossible for anything to reach its full potential. The human race is denied faster advancement and top quality in almost every single aspect of life because of it. ',\n 'Rule of discussion abortion is not up for discussion this time.

I dont want to see Jewish people killed off but I think they come from a disgusting tradition that shouldnt be receiving international support. If Im wrong in this please help me see that I honestly cant right now and as much as I believe everything Ive described below I cant help but feel like an awful person for writing off the value of an entire culture. Id appreciate any constructive feedback. Thank you. The Jewish history is a history of genocide... perpetrated by the Jewish people upon their smaller and weaker neighborsand occasionally by virtue of exceptional military leadership against larger and conventionally stronger neighbors. This goes back to ancient times but is clearly true in the present day Israelis are gathering in public places by the hundreds if not thousands dancing and singing things like There are no children left in Gaza Oleh! The Palestinians are the modernday descendants of the Philistines. The Israelis are simply perpetuating an agenda of ethnic cleansing that is thousands of years old. This is how the Israelis act displaying overwhelming support suggestions place public support for the ground campaign in Gaza as high as since when does of any public support anything its government does? for genocidal endeavors. This lasts until they come up against somebody too strong for them to defeat alone at which point its poor Israelis and persecuted Jews. World War II? The Holocaust was horrible. Id agree. Thank God well never forget all the Gypsies the homosexuals the mentally disabled and other groups that the Nazis persecuted. Yknow how they made the homosexuals wear pink triangles so theyd stand out from their neighbors and could be singled out for relocation and persecution? Wait you didnt know that? Well theres no surprise. God forbid that the Holocaust be about anyone else but the Jewish people. I dont know how the history books read in other countries in America nobody mentions anyone but the Jews. There are no photographs of anyone else being persecuted. Pink triangles pinned to homosexuals? Shit even a college education over here isnt guaranteed to go into that but I knew what a Star of David was when I was four years old and why it is so awful that Hitler did what he did to those poor Jewish people and it is awful beyond awful dont get me wrong. What about Jewish rituals? Kosher food is considered pure. Yknow why? Its because the animals are killed by being first immobilized then having their necks cut approximately halfway through with a slow sawing motion. The animal is left to bleed out in pain as Jewish tradition holds that the slow bleeding out and suffering of the animal renders the meat somehow pure. Literally the suffering adds flavor and probably another thing that was necessary thousands of years ago for health reasons that is no longer necessary but is one of those mindless traditions that is indulged in for the sake of being timehonored in the case of Jewish tradition however this seems to pass from quaint to sickeningly horrifying without much exception. Jewish culture is stuck in the mindset of a world that is thousands of years gone when it was literally kill or be killed for every little tribe on the planet and a few hundred people dead could mean the end of your ethnic group. The Jews lost in WWII and are currently a stronger force than they have ever before been in human history within living memory of the Holocaust... but they dont seem to have gotten that message. Small wonder perhaps given that theyre likely fairly indignant at how the lesser races of treated them. Jews all but invented the concept of the master race. They have a word for people who arent Jewishgentile. Now this isnt so distinct from other religious groups in some fashion southern Baptists routinely refer to other people as nonbelievers and uslims have the famous infidel but terms like these tend to have something in common they denote other people as being ideologically wrong in the viewpoint of the individuals using said terminology. This is not the case with gentile the Jews dont want to convert you. You arent pure. Gentile denotes people who are in Jewish tradition physically inferioras is also evidenced by their use of Jewish to describe themselves as a religious faith as a political state and as an ethnicity. Even the most hardcore hristians dont identify themselves as being ethnically hristian in fact theyd vehemently deny it stating that a person must be individually saved to be hristian. Not so the Jews. Theyre superior everybody else is inferior and they dont even particularly like it when someone wants to convert. And if nobodys actually giving them a hard time? Theyll make it up ample evidence suggests that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians its generally accepted that the Bible story of the enslavement is a complete fabrication. The Pyramids were built by Egyptian farmers and craftspeople who were paid for their labors and well taken care of and there is no sign of the economic collapse that would have occurred had a million slaves walked out of Egypt overnight. It is possible to honor your ancestors and revere those who fell in times of horrifying carnage and catastrophe without using it to justify an ongoing tradition of genocide barbarism and delusions of physiological superiority. Yet not only are the Israelis not doing this but we America are aiding and abetting them in their ongoing vileness. These people are targeting individual wheelchairbound people with helicopter rockets and beaches of small children with warships and were paying to refill their ammunition stockpiles. It leaves me feeling positively sick. They are literally one moral step away from walking into peoples living rooms and skinning their children alive or from sacrificing people to God but you cant say anything bad about the Jews. Have you ever noticed that? I dont much care for the JapaneseIndiansexicansHispanic peopleblack people or whoever and youre at least given a chance to explain but I dont like the Jewish people makes you an instant monster. ',\n 'ommunication is essential which is why school in the United States has an English class as one of the four core disciplines English ath Science History Everyone communicates but many do it poorly... So we deem it absolutely necessary to at least attempt refining ones ability to communicate through the education system as a vehicle. Philosophy is parallel to this. Everyone uses philosophy adopts philosophies spouts philosophies.... but the average person does it quite poorly. Abstract thought being able handle big questions... these are skills we should be beginning to equip people with at an early age. Philosophy has a bad wrap because in a productionconsumption society it has no tangible value but the value of philosophy as a discipline is intrinsic and can effect everything we do. Just a few obvious applications and benefits to adopting critical thinking philosophy as a core discipline are hild Rearing You bring a person into the world and are tasked with guiding them the best you can through the infinite chaos of life. What is the best way to do this? How much should you intervene? Understanding your actions have tremendous influence on their developing minds.... how should you try to act and communicate? These questions and many more are abstract in nature and could be argued to be essential for any prospective parent but so many of us are not equipped to tackle such large issues. We commonly say things like I dont even want to go there... or thats too deep for me... when touching upon huge philosophical quandaries. A society which encourages critical thought and teaches us how to approach abstract questions from an early age will eventually birth a a generation of by average more prepared parents. The effects of this could be immense. Bullying A child is caught bullying another child.... the bully is called into the guidance counselors office and is asked Why did you make fun of Johnny? The bullying child will likely be rolling his eyes and saying whatever it takes to get out of the guidance counselors office at this point... and the bullying behavior will likely continue. In a society where critical thinking skills are taught from an early age the child will be used to answering why questions and thinking inward. In more circumstances by average than would likely happen now the bullying child may actually benefit from the counseling. onformity Organized religion media peers etc. all have tremendous toxic weight on society. Freeing slaves allowing women to vote allowing homosexuals to marry allowing people to smoke weed..... these topics take far to long to filter through tradition. ritical thinking skills arm the populace with the notion of asking why and not accepting things at face value. Systems of control would have a much more difficult time normalizing the opinions of the masses. Of course the volume of examples could be vast but I assume if you are still with me you get the gist of what I am suggesting. Over the course of time a society that values critical thinking and philosophical thought as much as quantitative and linear thought would be a society that would evolve quicker and more efficiently with considerably less conflict and arbitrary systems of control.

Of course they could dispute the tip and refuse to pay but I suggest the added effort of the complaint process will discourage and minimize the nontipping customer base. One last thing.

One major issue I have with this is often teachersnurses present the issue of deodorant under the guise of hygiene. A kid not wearing deodorant isnt going to harm me its just going to gross me out when Im working with him one on one. Brushing your teeth is a matter of hygiene. Showering is a matter of hygiene. If a kids not doing these things then sure speak up. But its not our place to do so in the case of deodorant. So if that issue is resolved and telling a student that heshe needs to wear deodorant because of hygienic reasons isnt something that happens I still dont believe it is the teachers place to say anything to the student. The only remaining reason I see the student needs to wear deodorant is for the comfort of others. I feel its best to tell the student. I want himher to be as socially successful as possible... But its not like the kid wont make friends if heshe doesnt wear deodorant. He or she will just make a different kind of friends. In my mind its like telling a student she needs to shave her legs because they gross me out or that I think denim purses are wretched and people would like you more if you didnt carry that. They are wretched I dont think you can change my view on that.

',\n 'Let me preface this by saying Im an atheist and dont believe in any of this however if I did believe the hristian narrative was true I would probably worship Lucifer. The basis of this argument is in the fact that using deductive reasoning Yahweh is a manipulative liar. I should also add that Ill be using Lucifer and Satan synonymously if anyone wants to argue this Ill do it in the comments. Lets begin with Peter Ignoring for a moment the fact that this seems a questionable action of a good god the fact that there still exists a Lucifer who is seemingly not bound in chains of gloomy darkness but rather ruler of the underworld clearly indicative in some measure of tremendous power also calls into question Gods socalled omnipotence. Also although there is very little information about Lucifers fall from heaven in the bible how very convenient God it seems very irrational that somebody would try to challenge God in heaven given that heaven is supposed to be a utopia and why would somebody rebel in utopia? God is supposed to be allpowerful meaning that rebellion is futile. So were left with only two possible explanations. Either heaven is not a utopia and some people find Gods unchallenged authoritarian tyranny a questionable system of governance. God is not omnipotent or at the very least Lucifer is also phenomenally powerful. We can extrapolate from the incongruities in the logic of the information weve been given that God is clearly lying to us and either inflating the desirability of heaven or the measures of his own power or both. Why would somebody do this? It sounds like an elaborate propaganda campaign to win over the souls of humans at the behest of a corrupt tyrant. Plus if we conclude that God is a liar then nothing in the Bible can be taken for granted any more. But then why worship Lucifer? Well although theres very little information to go on in the Bible bad things are constantly blamed on the devil and since weve established God is a filthy propagandist this smells like an elaborate smear campaign and frankly some of it is a little fanciful. If we approach the Bible with the conclusion that God is trying to manipulate us many items that we would ordinarily take at face value become startling condemnatory evidence of a manipulative otherworldly dictator. For example orinthians This is exactly the kind of thing I would tell people if I was a megalomaniacal tyrant and wanted to use propaganda to get people to disregard my adversary. All hail Lucifer! The brave revolutionary freedom fighter! Dont be swayed by the poisonous lies! P.S. I did use the search bar and this came up once before but they used different logic so I thought Id try it again! ',\n 'I dont believe women want sex nearly as much as men do. This is a generalization of course. There are a great many women with high sex drives of course. But in general I believe that men at large are more desiring of sex. One reason I believe this is that men patronize prostitutes in significant numbers and men are willing to trade things of real value like money in order to get sex. I cant think of any scenario in which women are willing to give up something of significant value in order to get sex. I also believe this is true because testosterone is largely responsible for the human sex drive. The more testosterone you produce the more libidinous you are. en who have lower testosterone have less of a sex drive. These men seek out testosterone treatment and notice a dramatic increase in sex drive once the treatment becomes effective. Women produce significantly less testosterone than men consequently their sex drives are typically lower. Women are less proactive when it comes to seeking out sex partners. I dont have support for this one but in my experience men are the ones who are proactive about directly asking women out or making direct romantic gestures. Its usually incumbent upon men to do the asking to make the first move. en are compelled to play by these rules because women are the ones who have the thing that men desire and men are the ones who are forced to act because of the desire. Also men are much more likely to say yes to a request for an immediate sexual encounter than women are. According to this study women were much much less likely to say yes to a proposal for immediate sex whereas men were much much more likely to say yes. Watch this video. any of the men features men leap at the change to have sex with the girl despite the fact that she could be leading them into some kind of trap or that she could have an STD of some kind. There are only a few examples I know there is another video in which is about as well but the average of men that say yes it much higher than the average in the gender opposite video. The ones who dont leap to sleep with her at least seriously consider doing it this is because they want very badly to have sex with a beautiful girl. The women in this video dont react nearly as positively. None of them leap at the chance. They arent instantly aroused the way the men are by even the proposal. I think its reasonable to conclude that the desire just isnt as intense. You might argue that the desire becomes as intense when the desire is provoked and that this situation does not provoke the desire but if its so difficult to provoke the same amount of desire doesnt that mean that there is less desire in general? please!

Really Im of average intelligence but grew up privileged and my parents ensured that I was good at reading at a young age. I just read quickly. What clinched it for me was when they had to enter their prior registration number. One... digit... at... a... time. Even though Im not of great intelligence I know that most people are orders of magnitude worse at processing information than I am. For this reason I feel better poised to handle texting and driving. Lately Ive been putting my phone in the back of the car to quit the habit but Ive done it consistently for years and if I read like most people then this wouldnt be possible. by explaining why I should feel equally bad regardless of my textingdriving ability.

',\n 'So I think this is probably a pretty unpopular topic since most of the posts I see on the gaming subreddits are about how great older games are. This post was sparked after seeing a thread What games have aged incredibly well? on AskReddit and I found myself disagreeing with many of the titles picked. I recently purchased an N. I have many fond memories of playing that console at my friends houses back in the mid s but never having one myself because my mom forbade it. I decided to get one now that I am a self sufficient adult and play a few of the games I remember being awesome. I got Jet Force Gemini Star Wars Rogue Squadron Shadow of the Empire and Banjo Kazookie. After playing all the titles I found the controls difficult the graphics terrible and the whole experience just not fun. Take Rogue Squadron I remember it being high flying action with fun dynamic gameplay and a cast of awesome characters. What I got was essentially no story and aircraft that handle worse than most flash games available free online. Jet Force Gemini this one was the hardest for me to swallow. This was arguably my favorite game growing up and I found it unplayable. The aiming was all over the place the camera moves erratically and the polygonal look of the characters was terrible to look at. The main point I am trying to make is that how far gaming has come today has spoiled us. These old games were fine for what they were but when compared to the titles coming out today they pale in comparison. There are some titles that are still great however. I am not saying that all games from the s and before are bad. By and large these older games serve no other purpose in my mind than just feeding into this strange obsession everyone seems to have with nostalgia. Please change my view. ',\n 'Im from Nigeria Im currently studying in the United States and I am gay. Nigeria passed an incredibly homophobic law this January and Uganda and Kenya have followed suit. The long and short of it is that if I tried to live openly back home I would be put in prison for any period of time ranging from between and years. I realize that this law and others like it are possibly in violation of several human rights declarations which these countries have ostensibly ratified. I also want this law to be repealed and for this discrimination against sexual minorities to end. However as people who follow this issue are aware the African nations that have these laws on their books have resisted calls to repeal these laws. They view calls for repeal as the West trying to impose its moral standards on Africa which has expressed its morality through the passage of these laws. I am aware of the logical inconsistency of this position i.e. that the homophobia is a result of the adoption of religion which itself is a Western import and do not want to discuss that here. What I do wonder is that the leaders of these nations have asked that they be respected as sovereign nations and for the West to respect their laws. They say that just as they do not impose their cultural norms on the West the West should not impose their cultural norms on Africa and the most common example they cite is that of polygamy. It is very common in several African nations but I was surprised to learn is actually criminalized in the US and anada. So if the West criminalizes the African cultural practice of polygamy and is unwilling to repeal the laws that do so then surely African nations can criminalize homosexuality and the West should leave them alone. Im not sure how to mount an argument to this. The right to marry a consenting spouse is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights so if a womanman decides to marry another manwoman with an existing spouse it should not be criminal as long as the three of them consent to it. And if choice of spouse if one party is already married is already criminal in the West why cant it be criminal in Africa on the basis of gender? Please . ',\n 'While I was still going to public school in America most of my history classes focused more on the Declaration of Independence rather than the onstitution. We focused so much on it I thought that the Declaration of Independence was the most important document America ever had. While it definitely isnt unimportant the DoI was more a list of reasons why the King of England sucked and why they wanted independence as their own nation. The onstitution however is the backbone to how America is run far more relevant to modern American life than the Declaration. Granted st and nd graders might not fully understand what the onstitution is and its easier to teach the Declaration to them but I think that th and th graders would definitely be able to understand the basics of the onstitution Bill of Rights and amendments perhaps even rd graders. The Declaration is great for when you want to teach kids about the Revolutionary War. However theres not much of a need to spend so much time on it since in my opinion its just not as relevant to American life as the onstitution. While its important its more important to teach about history that had a bigger impact on todays world. The onstitution is a prime example for American life since its still being used and referenced all the time today! When was the last time you heard of the Declaration of Independence in the mainstream news? Okay Nicholas age stole it in a movie once but other than that nothing much. The onstitution is constantly in the news however and in order for any of the branches of government to do anything they have to look up the onstitution to see if its okay. I think that if we teach American kids early on what the onstitution is theyre more likely to know how the law actually works how the country is run and the actual intent the Founding Fathers had for America. They might also become more interested in politics in their adult lives since they would actually know how the American government is structured. Plus with the onstitution it would also help teach students how America changed over time and what the values and standards were for American people living a hundred or two hundred years ago. It might even get them to debate amongst themselves if they agree with parts of the onstitution or not and its important for kids to learn how to properly have a debate and not just a bunch of angry arguments. ost of the kids I know can barely name any amendments except for like freedom of speech and they seem to be under the impression that freedom of speech means that you can say whatever you want and shouldnt have to have any social repercussions for it right to guns and womens suffrage. Its almost like they only take the time to learn about the onstitution when they need to win an argument. Now my generation for lack of a better word is still young and we havent really fully developed into adults yet but how can a country be functional if the people dont know how their onstitution works including the parts they dont like about it? TLDR Kids would benefit more from learning about the onstitution at an early age rather than the Declaration of Independence. ',\n 'Lately Ive been reading up on the work of a man named Guy cPherson who is of the opinion that global warming will drive humanity to extinction within a few decades. The global temperature is increasing wildly and in a few years many heavily populated areas will exceed wet bulb temperature meaning they will become so hot that it would be impossible for human life to exist there. These areas would include much of the eastern and southeastern United States. This would lead to the collapse of much of civilization and untold numbers of deaths would surely follow. I admittedly dont know much about climate science and Im hoping if I did I would be able to dismiss this but from what Ive read it seems fairly solid. Even the US Navy has predicted an icefree arctic by which seems to support the idea that global warming is increasing at an exponential rate. I would really really like my view on this changed.

I believe that if America happens to be capable of physically enforcing a moral majority on a global scale then it should. Please change my view. Note I do not mean to say that America is the most effective moral judge nor that they are practicing the world police role effectively currently. I am speaking more hypothetically If a force capable of extending protection and advocacy to oppressed peoples is a good thing then the force capable of extending that protection ought to do so. I do no think that examples of past worldpolicing actions by America will change my view as I am more interested in this question prompting solutions to how an effective moral world police could or could not be achieved. I do not think America is currently the most moral just that they are the most capable given infrastructure equipment technology and manpower.

',\n 'So to start off I did a coop after my rd year of undergrad and got fired after four months for stressing out over little things at work which made a bad influence on others working there. I was obviously upset when I experienced this and as a result I performed poorly in my th year when I went back to school. I ended up with a GPA so low that it was an embarrassment to my Asian family who are sticklers about marks. I dont even wear the Iron Ring that you get after your engineering degree because I simply didnt deserve it. One day I took some time for myself to reflect what I did wrong in my life that led me to this situation. I came to realize that I was simply an emotional person overreacting to little things trying to achieve perfection and getting things right the first time. I want to achieve the last two things but the first thing was getting in my way. From that day on I decided to basically shut off my emotion to everyone and everything which took awhile to achieve. By shutting off my emotions I was able to get past what happened and wiping the memories. I then started thinking of procedures in my head when I encounter certain situations and control which emotions to express or not at all. For example I was making breakfast this morning when I dropped an egg on the floor by accident for the first time in awhile. The normal reaction that most people would make would be anger or frustration but I instead went straight to my room to get paper towels and clean up the mess without making a fuss about it. I seem to perform better than where I was over a year ago and stopped making mistakes recursively. By acting like a robot Im able to do things better and faster than I used to without the emotional distractions. I admit there are times when I have sudden bursts of emotion when I think about something e.g. crying but I take that as a deficiency and restabilize my mind back to robot mode which is still a challenge for me. It kind of makes me wish there was a delete function to remove memories like a computer can. Explaining my life background has gotten me to the view of seeing emotion as a flaw of humanity. Humans have been fighting each other since forever and I think emotion is what sometimes leads to bad decisions rather than using logic and reasoning. As a result we use our hearts rather than our minds to do things that we end up regretting in the end like the conflicts you see on the news and the decisions we make in our personal lives. I wonder if reddit had a different view on this.

With that being said I feel that the two game suspension administered by the NFL to Ray Rice is justifiable if not too heavy a punishment. If a court of law decides that the case shouldnt go to trial why should Roger Goodell suspend him for any extended amount of time? I agree that he should face some form of discipline and two games seems a fair punishment if not excessive. However the media has chastised Goodell and the league for condoning domestic violence and not taking a stand. This seems unfair to all parties involved in my opinion.

When you pay off a debt the amount you were paying towards it each month is an instant raise to yourself. If you pay off a loan that was month you suddenly have month extra to budget with. Paying off a small debt instantly adds to your emergency fund. Your monthly expenses are now less so you need less of an emergency fund. It wipes small debts out completely. If you stop paying off debts for whatever reason you still have immediate benefits from your efforts because youve eliminated a few monthly payments. If a financial issue like a disability or long term unemployment comes up you wont rack up interest and late fees on a debt that doesnt exist. Eliminating the number of payments you have makes it easier to keep track of them and not miss any or incur late fees. Its also psychologically better to have fewer debts you owe. Im aware that mathematically it is cheapest to pay it off in the order of highest to lowest interest but I think that the benefits I listed out are worth paying a little extra interest for.

These characters play no role in the story other than as inconvenient or dangerous obstacles to be shot or stabbed or set on fire. ompared to that individual female characters with names being sexually objectifiedcaptured by the bad guy killed as a plot device isnt too bad.

BB says At some moment all matter in the universe was contained in one single point. The Big Bang took place causing this matter to expand and marked the beginning of the Universe. This matter must have always existed because based on the laws of science matter cannot be created. In other words all matter in the universe must have no beginning and no end.

Also since this is within the context of school its not like female students dont have opportunities to join girls sports teams. In addition to that for many sports girls have their own teams so if we allow female students to play on male students sport teams should the opposite be allowed to happen? I just believe that it would help female and male students have more confidence and develop better as athletes if they are playing with people of similar or equal ability.

As it stands right now unemployment raises because we Im speaking mostly about the United States outsource jobs to other countries or to our technologies. This is a battle we are never going to win because technology increases exponentially. Also population is on the raise. eaning we will reach a point where there will be far more people than traditional jobs. If we set up a universal minimum allowance then we can fix poverty and fix the unemployment problem. Will this allow people to be lazy? Yes. But will it also give people the freedom and choice to go after jobs they enjoy? I think so. For example I work retail and I actually enjoy it. Some countries are already trying something close to this out. And as far as how will we pay for it? I believe those countries are converting their welfare programs into this new system.

Intro First and foremost we need a concrete definition of art. A quick search gives us this While this is good enough I dont think its sufficient. This may be the definition of art but it is hardly the purpose. The purpose of art imo is to convey a complex idea. And that is really what comes into question when it comes to ideo Games. Nobody could really contest that a game creator uses creative skill and imagination to make their product. The contention comes when you think about whether games convey an idea or are simply entertainment. In the rest of this post I will show firstly the difference between things in a medium that do and do not fulfill the purpose of art. I will then show how video games are a superior art form as opposed to moves painting and the like. Finally Ill show some examples of games that fit into the categories of art and nonart. I realize that Im dealing with a lot of abstracts here and its impossible to be truly objective but Ill do my best to represent what I mean. What does and does not fit the definition and purpose of art The easiest medium for this would be photography. First ill show some pictures that fulfill neither the definition or purpose of art this is not art this is not art and this is not art  The second category is a bit more difficult but here are some that fit the definition of art but not the purpose This fits the definition of art so does this and this They are all certainly a product of human creativity and fit the definition of art. But what complex idea do they convey do they meet the purpose of art? Finally pictures that meet both the definition and purpose of art This is one Another Id even say this too I was planning to do music and movies as well but these media are much more difficult to breakdown and as a result it would make this about twice as long and three times as abstract. Why ideo Games are a Superior Art Form The main idea here is that video games are interactive. You directly experience the feeling or idea that is being represented in the work. This makes it a much more powerful and personal experience than watching a movie or listening to a song. I have never went to a friend and talked for minutes about how a song in which the artist was portraying their anger and talked about how angry I was. But I have had a bad game experience and went to talk to my friend for minutes about how I was mad. What im trying to say is best represented in this quote ...you dont have to empathize with a character on a screen the feeling happens directly to you. Its like taking the phrease show dont tell and moving it to the next level feel dont show. I find that games are the best art form because they fulfill the purpose of art in a way no other medium thus far can possibly hope to. ost of this power comes from good game design but this is also true of other forms of media. A badly made movie will fail to show the struggle of a fatherson dynamic as well as The Godfather. I realize that this is going to be the most controversial pert of my post so fell free to reply even if you think that video games are an art form but not the best as I claim here. What games do and do not fit the definition and purpose of art Note I am not saying that the games listed here are good or bad simple whether or not the fit the definition and purpose of art. Ill be using commonplace titles so that even people who dont play very many games will have a general idea about what game Im talking about. Games that do not fit the definition of art FIFA Farmville and Solitaire . You can see that most of these are simulations of things in real life and are not very creative mostly they fill the purpose of simple entertainment or time filling. This is not to say that simulations cannot be artful as rd World Farmer is a simulation game that fulfills the purpose of art very well. Games that fit the definition of art but not the purpose. Super ario Bros. Its hard to think of specific examples of this but I think the one is sufficient. Its a very creative and well designed game. Nest are games that fulfill both the definition and purpose of art. In this section Ill talk for a short biit about what parts of these games make it artful. Amnesia The Dark Descent this game is fear and panic incarnate. ark of the Ninja ever wonder what its like to be a ninja? Papers Please this game is really difficult to describe pretty much you are a worker at the boarder of an oppressive dictatorship its definitely worth a play if you are looking got something truly unique. Lastly Antichamber for if you ever want to break your brain. With games I have added a th category that comes directly due to interactivity. These ae games that can be art. I think what I mean by that will become more clear as I show some examples. all of Duty of course you have the well known year old who slept with everyone mother but many parts of this game are powerful message about what war is like there are better representations of this but this game fits this category very well. League of Legends this game can be anything from a mindless time sink to an immersive experience where you directly experience victory defeat panic triumph fear and even the occasional sportsmanship. The Elder Scrolls Skyrim this is truly the best representation of this category anybody who has played can tell you about the amazing landscapes I just gotta freak out for a second when I first saw the Soul airn my brain exploded. And the last area of the main quest just makes you feel like a badass who has crossed worlds to beat this evil its just awesome. The potential art in this game is immense from the world design even to how the character interacts allows the player to fell and be something the never could. This is what I mean by the category can be art. These games fulfill the purpose of art if the player makes it so. TLDR Games are a superior art form because they have interactivity and allow the player to directly feel the idea that is being conveyed by the creators. This at its core fulfills the purpose of art better than any other medium can. All media have things that are art and that are not art. Just because you can point to some games that are not artistic does not mean the medium is invalid as a form of art. ',\n 'So Lena Dunham has once again caused another stir in the social justice world by asking twitter why they need birth control. First of all even as a woman I find that an extremely childish point of view. To need birth control. I would like to preface this by saying that yes I am aware of the various conditions that birth control aides and for the sake of this those are not what Im talking about here. For all nonmedical reasons no one needs birth control. I am a huge advocate for safe sex and the prevention of pregnancy and the spread of STDs through birth control and condoms. That being said I dont think sex is a basic human right. No one needs to have sex every three days or theyll face death maiming etc. Sex is pleasurable and sex is fun and sex can create life. But by no means is it a necessity in the way that many claim it is. Furthermore claiming that your healthcare should be required to cover birth control outside of health concerns because its a basic right is absolutely ridiculous. If you are not prepared to make birth control a priority by budgeting for it then you need to make the decision to either practice unprotected sex and face the consequences or abstain until you can afford to make birth control a priority. Here are some of the main reasons why I think so Birth ontrol doesnt have to be super expensive as low as a month. If you cant afford a month for birth control you definitely cant afford a kid and should be able to abstain until you are more financially stable. There are other nonpenetrative methods for sexual release If you cant make birth control a priority for your own personal budget then why should you expect your health care to. I know this treads very closely with past s on birth control being included in health care but in this case I think its hard to talk about one without the other. I personally think persecuting companys for refusing to provide birth control in their health care package not that the woman couldnt just buy it without insurance! is as assine as getting upset if an orthodox jewish meat company refused to purchase pork for their work cafeteria. I feel like Im one of the few feminists and I use that term very loosely who doesnt believe that sex is a basic human right. ?

',\n 'Ok first a couple caveats. I have never been a sports fan and I find obsessing over sports ridiculous. Not mearly watching a game but the obsession of them. But that is not what this is about I just think its important and fair to be clear where Im coming from. What this is stemming from is that I watched a documentary last night Schooled the Price of ollege Sports. If you want a more in depth understanding you can watch it or Ill just give the very brief summary as I understood it. One side says players should be compensated for the work they do. The other side says it is essentially extracurricular activities and they are students merely taking part in activities while at college and that paying them would ruin college sports. Now this was a pretty slanted documentary but I was still able to appreciate the perspective from both sides. On one hand the reality is that college sports players are part of a big business that makes lots of money. On the other hand school should exist for learning not creating a big profit making businesses centered around sports. y view is this The problem is not the coaches or the schools making money and not paying the students afterall they all just have a job and are trying to be paid as best that they can. Fine I have no issues with that. On the other hand those students are making a LOT of money for other people and not seeing a dime for it. What the problem really is to me is that people should stop supporting the entire system altogether. Paying or more... If you want sports entertainment you should go pay professional sports entertainment. The only reason those sports should exist within a college setting is for the players themselves something to do on the side while theyre attending school. The moment the populace starts being willing to pay them vast sums of money and pay such a mind to star college athletes they have become the problem. Leave the students alone to learn and do what they want to do on the side while theyre there. I say the fans are the only solution to the problem because both the NAA and the Studentathletes are right in what they say. The fact is there just shouldnt be that much money being generated for college sports and the only reason there is is because fans are obsessive and willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to them. I believe fans are wrong to do this and should stop and that if youre a fan of college sports a paying fan of college sports that you should stop contributing to a problem that can only be solved by you ceasing to provide them so much ridiculous money. ',\n 'Hey . Ive been trying to think of a view of mind I could post here and this just came to me all of a sudden. So I dont think Italians Jews Arabs or Greeks should really be considered white people. Now Ive got nothing against any of those people I just think there is no possible definition of white that applies to them. At the most basic level there skin isnt white. Obviously this varies from person to person but I dont think the average Italian is any whiter than say the average Hispanic person. They arent aucasians because they didnt come from the aucasus mountains. Its not a big deal but I think its a bit ridiculous that these guys are supposed to be the same as these guys who are completely different from these guys. hange my view? ',\n 'I believe this for several reasons including ost importantly large insurance companies will take a hit from this and we all know who calls the shots in the US government the big corps. To be fully effective all cars on main roads would have to be automated. How would this happen logistically? Would the automatic driving capabilities be installed or would you need a whole new car? If you need a car built for this then what would happen to all the old dumb cars? And who would pay for all the dumb cars to be re purposed? In conclusion I really dont see how these driverless cars are a possibility but hopefully someone can inform me and possibly change my opinion thanks! Finally there are simply too many people who wouldnt trust a system like that. For example many people are too afraid to ride on a plane because it is out of there control however they are comfortable driving long distances even though it is statistically much more dangerous. ',\n 'These companies are here to get us by when things dont go to plan financially in our lives. They are short term fixes here to help us yes they are a business but like many they are here to provide a service to those in need. The newstragic stories you here about people committing suicide and going into severe depression when behind on payments is no fault of the companies lending money. They clearly set guidelines and warn customers of the consequences of not repaying and it is only down to the incompetence of those suffering who dont bother to read understand the consequences of not paying on time or at all before binding themselves to a contract. Also I dont see why legal loan sharkspayday loan companies are frowned upon and chastised as immoral and repugnat when in reality they give similar punishments as banks do when their customers dont pay their mortgages. I dont see how repossession of ones home is more moral than extortionate interest rates. If we look to ban loan companieslegal loan sharks on the basis of immorality we should ban mortgages too on the same basis. Pay on time and everything is fine and both you and the company have fulfilled your contractual obligations. Dont pay on timestalldont pay at all then Im afraid you deserve everything that comes to you. ',\n 'If we go back to the actual meaning of NSFW Not Safe For Work the idea is clearly that you dont want something on your screen that someone at work could oversee. I believe that this applies really only to images and that it isnt necessary for text posts. An image requires only a glance to get you in trouble. If someone walks into your office or can see over your shoulder from across the room an image on your screen of someones intestines hanging out or some topless lady is something theyre going to recognize and possibly get you in trouble for. A text post on the other hand just looks like reddit. Unless someone stands over your shoulder long enough to actually read and comprehend whats on the screen then its no more eyecatching than any other textbased webpage that you might be on. If they recognize it as reddit and dont have a problem with you being on reddit at work the odds are low that seeing fuck on the screen is going to be what crosses the line into inappropriate use of company resources. Normally this would simply be an annoyance but many of us use the RES NSFW filter for just this purpose and as a result dont see a high number of text posts that got flagged as NSFW because someone asked a question that might result in someone saying sex. So . onvince me that there really is text on here worth guarding from view at work. ',\n 'I am quite open to changing my view on this topic. Id like somebody to talk me through the economic reasoning for having interest before discussing the pros and cons and moral implications. The reason I believe it should be banned at the moment is because it allows money to be made simply from having wealth. It is a vehicle for the wealthy to accumulate wealth from the poor. Also there is no choice. If you want a loan or have a bank account you UST payreceive interest. There is no way you can withdraw your consent on ideological grounds therefore we are trapped by interest. What are the results of this? It means payday loan companies like wonga can carry out statesanctioned theft of your possessions and home to cover your debts. It means that you are penalised for not being rich. To say this is allowed when really there is no way you can disagree with the system seems wrong to me. But why ban it? I admit I have only been clued into this view because usury is something that is criticised in Abrahamic religions. y view is not well informed and so I would like some people to convince me of the opposite view. . So the main benefits of interest seem to be compensating financiers for lending money allowing small businesses to have access to capital and allowing people to own items they otherwise wouldnt be able to. I am realising that economies will grind to halt if financiers cannot make money out of lending money without a viable alternative. . There does seem to be an alternative to interest in the form of Islamic Banking whereby interest is not charged. Another system has been illustrated by uProjectShamrock here Whether these are good or bad systems is still unclear to me but it illustrates alternatives are possible. . The way we charge interest in western societies directly empowers financiers. It is banks who decide interest rates not their customers who lend them money when they open a bank account or the borrowers. ',\n 'I heard this saying several years ago and I think it captures my foreign policy stance perfectly. A little background I live in America. Some of you probably already know where I am going. It seems like my country is out to solve every problem in the world. Just recently Ive heard people calling for a nuclear standoff with Russia over rimea. That we should send ground troops to secure the crash site of that alaysia airlines flight that got shot down. And theres the constant demand for more involvement with the IsraelPalestine conflict. I could go on listing examples but Id be here all day. Everything from North Korea to Josef Kony a significant bloc of American citizens thinks that it is our job to swoop in and save the day. I ask why? What significance does any of that have for our country? Because all I see is our sons and daughters being sent to die in someone elses conflict. Not to mention the billions of dollars that get spent in the process. Why not let the rest of the world police itself for a change? ',\n 'I dont understand how many people are okay with dropping k on a ring and then k on a wedding ceremony. Its a giant waste of money that could be spent on other things more worth while house education possessions... What is the point of spending all this money on an event? If its supposed to be a declaration of two peoples love for each other then why does it need to be so materialistic? I dont see a reason to even get married in the first place unless a situation demanded it. I dont think marriage is needed to have sex prove your love or even have kids. Two people can be committed and happy without spending a bunch of money or having a new title to officially declare themselves. What really is the point of getting married if youre not doing it for religious reasons? ',\n 'Just as a preface I am not a speed runner and I dont watch a terrible amount of speed running. The majority of my knowledge comes from a few Super eat Boy speed runners and Dark Souls speed running. It seems a common tactic in the speed running community to use tricks in the game to quickly get ahead. This is exactly what you would expect from someone trying to finish the game as fast as possible however often times these tricks can cause the player to completely skip a large portion of the game. y main example would be whats referred to as the Brownie Skip in Super eat Boy. Brownie is a boss in super meat boy on the world called the Salt Factory. In order to beat him you have to outrun him through a maze like structure and get to the top of the structure. Doing this normally could take a little longer than a minute. Perhaps less I dont know the exact amount of time but definitely significantly more than when using the exploit. Performing the Brownie Skip the player is placed into the race runs immediately to the right outside of few and pauses the game and then ends up being able to land on top of the platform that was initially impeding their progress. If you dont know or that explanation didnt make sense here is what it looks like. In my opinion this and tactics like it dont belong in speed running. While it does make you beat the game faster youre not actually playing the game. Youre playing who knows how and when to pause the game and how to wiggle the stick the best. The idea of speed running is about being able to beat the game the fastest and bosses are an important part of the game. Actually beating the boss shows off more skill by far. ! ',\n 'I often hear people discussing gun control legislation as common sense seemingly as a way of getting out of having to actually explain the logic behind them. To me the most significant manifestation of this issue is the tremendous amount of support for legislation that would disallow anyone diagnosed with a mental illness to own a firearm. At first thought such a measure seems to make sense. Surely this legislation would make it such that dangerous mentally ill people cannot obtain firearms making the world a safer place. But consider this. A man returns from active duty and decides that he wants to purchase a pistol to protect himself. The man is experiencing PTSD symptoms but knows that if he seeks help he will be barred from purchasing a gun so what does he do? He hides the symptoms hes experiencing and he buys a gun. So then instead of having an armed mentally ill man who is seeking treatment and whose symptoms are being controlled you have an armed man who needs medication or at the very least professional help. Legislation like this deters people from seeking help for their mental illnesses and puts guns in the hands of more unstable people. To me thats why this type of legislation makes no sense. But Im open to changing that opinion so please . ',\n 'y understanding of P is that he serves mainly as comic relief in the movies. However hes in way too many scenes to the point that he just gets annoying. PO does nothing to drive the story forward. I feel that you could actually remove him from all of the films and the plots wouldnt really change that much. The only thing hes good at is language interpretations but he doesnt fill that role often enough to justify him getting so much screen time. If PO was in fewer scenes he would be a decent character but the fact that hes in so many and the fact that hes actually kind of useless really damages our enjoyment of the character. Who do you think is the worst character in the Star Wars movies and why is that character worse than PO? ',\n 'First to the issue of consent. an an year old give consent? that is almost a definite no. But past that if a kid can give consent to be picked up to be punched by his friends to ride a bike to ride a car why can heshe not give consent to sex? Of course this view must hold that those even those younger than those that can speak can give consent but I wont go there in this as I will get a bunch of hate mail and witchhunts as is common in western societys irrational hatred of anyone defending the pedos. So what makes sex so taboo for children? I argue that it is subjective. You grew up seeing it as dirty so you dont want your or others children engaging in it because you see it as dirty and want to keep their innocence for as long as possible. Other crimes such as murder assault and robbery are much more objective they do clear harm and clearly violate anothers right to life their body and their property. So to expand on this. If a year old can give consent to a or something of that sort why then can they not give consent to someone much older? It is because you view it as icky. I will admit in the majority of cases the child is a victim of rape. So clearly if the victim speaks out soon or later the case should be looked into and prosecuted with the right evidence. But it is clear to me that if a yo can give consent to a yo then he can give consent to anyone. On to the next part sex offenders registry is complete bullshit. First of all I fucking hate background checks. They perpetuate poverty and only cause more crime. It makes it hard for criminals to get jobs and they resort back to crimes. On top of that sex offenders are treated so much worse. Why does raping someone adult or child make you so much worse than someone who murdered and didnt get life? It is bullshit. There is the argument but then how would we know if theres a sex offender living next door to my children! Well thats incredibly unfortunate that you dont get to know everyones backgrounds so you can keep your precious little critters safe but that should be your responsibility. People make mistakes but should be able to return to being normal human beings citizens when they do their time. Not to mention that the prison system does not help pedophiles change their ways at all. That needs to change as well. Furthermore the most egregious of these I find is the acceptance on reddit though suprisingly the internet is far better at condemning this than the regular population to pedophiles being beat stabbed and raped in jail. Reddit and chan are actually decent compared to regular society in recognizing that this is fucking insane! It happens way to often. And there is little activism against the abuse sex offenders get in prison or even abuse in general in prison. So I clearly feel very strongly about this youll get bonus points from me if you change my opinion about that last one. But about all of these I guess. If a good argument comes a long that I havent thought of Ill change my view. ',\n 'I need to preface my thoughts initially by saying that holding this view does not mean I devalue cheerleading in any way. I have attended competitions and known several friends who cheerlead and though I am a very active physically fit person I would still find it challenging to learn and execute many moves in cheerleading and find it impressive and enjoyable to watch. However I dont consider it a sport. This is not a pejorative assertion but even so I have experienced pushback for it in the past. I also dont subscribe to the Olympic definition of sport. In my view a sport needs to be able to be won by objective means. That is to say you need to have a goal that can be reached make it to a certain point first score more points lift the most weight etc. Obviously officials make wrong calls and goals in hockeysoccer for instance are wrongly disallowedwrongly given occasionally but at the end of the day there is still an objective resultoutcome but for the number of games they decide on the merit of the mistake alone Im willing to consider them a reasonable minority. Team A Team B Usain Bolt wins race with time of . seconds etc. I believe events decided solely by judges cannot be sports and will always be subjective in nature. Sports like boxing with judging elements are still sports in my view because there is an objective way to win knocking the opponent out so they cannot respond to a count for instance. The judging is a tiebreaker and I am fine with that. But in judgeonly events an identical routine could win one contest and lose another simply by virtue of human subjectivity alone. For this reason I lump cheerleading in with figure skating diving and other events as athletic activities.

All of the houses that are in the neighborhood have driveways if not multiple car garages. I think thats dumb. Now if you drive through the neighborhood there are no cars on the street so its not like nonresidents were taking up spots for residents. Even with cars parked on both sides of the street the road is not narrow. I think there is no logistical reason for it. I think people who lived there got angry for no reason about people parking on their street and complained to the county. I dont think these people have any right to this road because I pay into the same tax pool that they do to maintain the street. Any citizen should have the right to park on any public street.

I believe there are perfectly good alternatives to eating meat if one can afford it such as pulses beans etc and that therefore it is unnecessary to kill animals for protein no doubt something that cause considerable distress to them. note that they may have to live in dodgy conditions as well as being slaughtered. . It would also be good for the environment as I believe animal rearing contributes hugely to global warming perhaps justifying a meat free life. Equally it would free up huge amounts of crops that could feed needy people ? or assorted others. Final note As a human being I believe I have a moral responsibility to try and prevent suffering as I have freedom of choice What differentiates me and a bear is free will to make moral decisions which a bear is incapable of understanding. Therefore I should try and be a veggie. That said maybe I should sell my house and live as a hermit donating my earnings to the poor ultimately however I am selfish and unwilling to do this although perhaps I should.

',\n 'Theres several mitigating factors to rich peoples generosity I want to put forth in support of my view any people are wowed by the amounts of zeros present in the gift and forget that proportionately to the givers income the gift may have been piddling. Generosity is defined as showing a readiness to give more of something as money or time than is strictly necessary or expected. From what I know Id say that in richer circles donating to something andor someone is in fact expected and that you may be perceived badly if you dont donate. Giving above a certain amount can serve as cheap advertising for those donating and serves to increase their reputation with the public. The tax benefits available for those who donate at large amounts can offset the cost of donating and I believe even provide an incentive to give in the first place. There is a line for each person that differs Im sure that below which they are scraping by and above which they do not need to worry about making ends meat or having small luxuries. Someone making in excess of figures certainly lives a very comfortable life even if they cant afford that nd private jet they were drooling over. Lastly Ill put forth what I think is a better way of deciding whom to call generous and whom to not. ake it a rule that unless sacrifice of some sort factors into your gift you are not being generous. Therefore if I donate money to an AIDS research foundation and as a direct result cannot buy the new fancier computer I wanted then I am generous. If a millionaire donates proportionately the same amount but it forces them to change nothing then they are not. The bigger the sacrifice the more generous the person. And yes if a millionaire decides to donate the money they intended to spend on a yacht meaning they dont get a boat or even get a smaller one than what they wanted Id consider that a sacrifice and therefore that they were being generous. I also add that I personally value the gift of time and effort above most monetary gifts because thats something that everyone values about the same. I realize I can be tone deaf when communicating sometimes but I did not mean to imply that not being called generous specifically means you are not doing something good. You absolutely are and clearly those who have more and give very little of it help finance things more than a collective of persons with meager wealth. The point I was initially making was that generous is a very high praise to offer someone and I feel that it can at least sometimes be perceived as a cheap way earning praise for very little. Im reminded of the Biblical story of the woman who gave her last cents in offering and was praised by Jesus as giving more than anyone else. Thats basically the comparison Im making. This view was not in any way meant to comment on how people should receive donationsgifts. Any gift given freely is worth thanking and worthy of praise from the recipient. Nowhere in my view did I state or insinuate that anyone was entitled to anything. I have several rich friends and dont believe for a second that Im entitled to any of their money at all. What rich people feel is their responsibility to give is no ones business but their own. ',\n 'When you have a slow network you dont improve it by upgrading the fastest nodes. I believe this analogy applies to the capitalist ideology that the best thing for the economy is massively successful megacorporations. I believe we as a society need to focus on social welfare improving the living standard of our weak nodes for the good of the total network. This is obviously quite a redditfriendly view but the contentious part is that I believe this network analogy is applicable in the sense that if we focussed on getting our countries whole populations above the poverty line and further this would be an investment in our future that would pay off in similar economic dividends to when a network service provider invests in upgrading old infrastructure. hange my view.

By doing this eBay are trying to force sellers to satisfy of buyers. Because there is some irreducible percentage of buyers who are unreasonable this is never going to actually work. Getting an unreasonable buyer is random and accordingly there will be sellers who get pushed out due to nothing more than the bad luck of getting several unreasonable buyers in a row. No matter how good you are your eBay account now has a halflife. This is a consequence of an American cultural malaise fivestarism the drive towards unreasonable standards of perfection and the perfect is the enemy of the good. A pass is a good mark. Three star service is actually good service. Three stars means that it wasnt noticably great or noticably terrible you just got exactly what you wanted. Every transaction that you did today that you didnt even notice what you got there was three star service. You deserve three star service. What makes better service better is that you didnt actually deserve it. In a sane world if you get better than acceptable service thats four stars. If you get the best service youve ever seen thats five. If you were disappointed in some way which is clearly attributable to the service provider but you still got moreorless what you wanted thats two stars. If they were completely incompetent and absolutely failed you thats one star. Or zero if they intentionally angered you. However those who decide these things in eBay Uber Walmart Blizzard various American call centres etc etc have all somehow come to the bizarre decision that acceptable should mean five stars and anything less than five stars is unacceptable. I took an Uber ride the other day. I rated the guy five stars for no other reason than that I knew that if I did not he would be punished. He had done nothing wrong. He did exactly what I expected of him. No more no less. He deserved three stars. I wanted to be able to give him that rating without any concern for his continued employment well his contract. This state of affairs completely grinds my gears. It destroys the very purpose of having rating systems at all. It converts the rating system back to a binary badgood with no meaningful distinction between those ratings. Worse it makes no actual provision for recognition of genuinely good service. If you rate any seller who sent the thing out in acceptable condition within acceptable time as five star how do you fairly rate the one who sent it out quicker than you expected better packed and the item in better condition than you were told? How do you rate the Uber driver who showed up early got you to your destination quickly and had a great conversation with you? Am I wrong? Have I missed something here?

If I was being attacked by an lb german shepherd dog for example Im pretty sure I could fight it off given that I keep a upright and stable stance and dont allow any loose appendages for the dog to grab on to. In an ideal situation where I could see him coming I know Im taller and stronger than him so all I would need to do is brace my legs so that when its charging at me it doesnt tackle me to the ground. I could probably manhandle a dog of that size or punch it in the face or pull on its fur or shove my fist down its throat or do something in the heat of the moment to disable the dog. The only real threat from the dog is the teeth right? so as long as you dont get shocked from him biting you all you need to do is keep a tall upright dominant position and wrestle the dog to the ground and induce submission death knock out exhaustion etc. Now this is assuming that the dog doesnt have a handler who is also after me in which case yeah Id be screwed. But in the event I am facing a charging attack dog coming towards me with absolutely no element of surprise on completely flat terrain with no handler and no weapons including me and the dog for the dog this would be something like a spiked collar or other metal implements Im fairly confident I could wrestle it into submission. .

I like to consider myself a man of action and I cant stand when people use this word in this sense to me it seems as though people have given up actually making progress toward improving their situation and deciding that it is out of their hands. I predict that the story of a kid with a disease will come up and this is a tough one but realistically if I was that parent with the sick child there would be no Hope there would be action I would be doing everything I possibly could to help alleviate the childs symptoms make him more comfortable or raise money for his cause. To me hoping is like resting and assuming that something good will come from inaction.

The coworker gets me the files he was working on I look them over and give him some notes. I notice its taking him an unusually large amount of time to do a routine task and I check in on him. I ask to check out what he has so far to see if it works so if it doesnt I can save him some time down the line. He says no. Long story short we have conflict It was utterly ridiculous for him to flat out refuse. At the end of it he says Sorry man my friend died today and Im not at my best workwise.

Im traveling in London in college with a couple of friends guy and a gal who are closer to each other than with me. The guy is straightedge no drugsalcohol but claims hes ok with us drinking. Were at a fish and chips restaurant and we order a beer. We start talking about drinking and I halfseriously suggest he should try it in the way friends do until he straight up starts crying. The gal asks me to go away while she calms him down I leave and come back and we leave. The guy is acting weird all week and Im sure hes mad at me. Like really really mad at me. Eventually the girl pulls me aside and says He didnt want me to tell you this but his grandma passed away and thats why hes acting like this. I feel like social standards dictate that grieving people have a right to act in nearly any way they want and its pretty much okay but I cant help but feel wronged in both these scenarios. I think if someone is dealing with something so profound as death and loss and is in close quarters with me by nature of work travel or so on that I have a right to know that theyre dealing with that and that they have a responsibility to tell me whats happening. When I think about it without those experiences Im inclined to believe that grieving people get a carte blanche as long as their grieving process doesnt hurt anyone. But in both the scenarios I experienced I felt wronged and a bit pissed at the people who are grieving for not clueing me in. Overall Im eager to hear what the hivemind has to say either way.

Im a white something middleclass housewife with no children and no plan on having any in the near future. I live with my husband on the edge of the wealthy part of town in an inexpensive but extremelywellkept apartment complex. To the north of us are designer stores sprawling mansions spas country clubs and organic groceries. To the south of us are much more ordinary neighborhoods. y husband works for my father and makes approximately dollars a week after tax. I dont work. Im a fulltime student and my uppermiddleclass parents pay for the entirety of my education. Id say were doing quite well for ourselves especially having only been married a year ago. I wouldnt consider myself to be rich or upper middle class but I enjoy the finer things in life like designer clothes and very expensive scotch. I just watched a documentary called Seperate yet Unequal about a Louisiana city district trying to break off its wealthier half of the city and create a new gentrified city. Advocates of the plan to split off said it meant better schools and a better life in general for the new citys citizens. I was rooting for those who wanted the new city instead of being horrified. I like gentrification it means Starbucks and decent shopping malls. It means less ghettos and thugs and crime. Those who opposed it talked about the fact that poor people would be left behind in the old city. ant the old city just have construction projects to make things nice and shiny and new? Apartment complexes can start refurbishing projects and suburbs can have contests for who can DIY their house to look the nicest. Stores and shop owners can clean up a little better and the city itself can have a recycling program or a treeplanting program or something. Itll only become a second Detroit if the citizens allow it to. The citizens of the old city can live on the fringes of the new one like my husband and I do. Technically speaking were not in the rich part of town but because of its very close proximity our apartments are just as wellkept as the expensive villas a neighborhood over. We have our own clubhouse gym pool and all the luxury amenities are within walking distance. Luxury living at ghetto prices! Problem solved! ...Right? Am I missing something here? The people in the documentary seemed outraged as though this wasnt something they knew how to fix. I dont understand. Please help me understand their point of view. aybe youll in the process. ',\n 'There is a big thing among certain believe groups that it is their job to educate and tell of those with incorrect views in public. People on the far left the very religious atheists and hardcore supporters of a paticular product brand come to mind. This can understandably piss many people off. This is especially true if the group or individual was minding their own business and an outsider barges in to tell them off. Normally considered a very rude thing to do. Now the people that do this do it because they think they are doing good for the world and I can understand that. What is moral is a very subjective thing though it is a human creation in the minds of the people. The universe is cold and indifferent to human action. The person who you are yelling at doesnt see themselves as the bad guy. Given this the people that engage in such behavior should stop acting victimized when their target yells at them tells them to fuck off or threatens them instead of listening. I have no sympathy for someone who barges into anothers personal space and starts making trouble for them. In my mind they are reaping what they sowed. ',\n 'People in my neighborhood just got notified that a house recently sold to a corporation and they have the intention of turning it into a group home. We went to a meeting last night to get some details on exactly what that means and Im worried that it is going to be very bad for the neighborhood. y concerns are . The company may potentially be moving dangerous people into the house. I live in a very quiet residential neighborhood and the thought of drug addicts being housed near me is disturbing. Even if the residents are well behaved there is going to be traffic of their friends who Im assuming will be similar in nature. The company wont say who may be living there. It could be just infirm elderly people but it could also be sexual predators for all I know. . y house will lose value when people find out that it is near a group home. Even if it isnt logical Im assuming that when someone is looking to buy my house they will be put off by the presence of group home nearby. . The business buying the house is a taxfree organization. I dont exactly know what that means but I assume that they wont be paying property taxes. That means that they will be consuming resources but not paying for them and my share of the community taxes will increase. . Even if this particular place only houses people who are complete angels this will set a precedent and open up the neighborhood for other homes and there is no guarantee that the other homes will be run as well. So thats it. Id love to hear from someone with experience with group homes moving nearby to tell me that all of my concerns are invalid. And in truth my real view is that I dont know if my uninformed opinions are correct or not so if you happen to be able to confirm my thoughts Id consider that to be changing my view as well. ',\n 'Whenever I order a steak in a quality steakhouse I order it well done. I know this is considered tabboo to many people but here are my views Why I prefer welldone steak First of all by well done I mean brown all the way through which is not the same as completely burned so that the steak resembles a hockey puck in appearance and flavor. I have had some phenomenal steaks cooked well done at moderatetoupscale steakhouses and the outside was barely charred at all. After trying steaks cooked to a variety of temperatures I feel that well done is the best according to my tastes. I dont feel that the flavor is substantially lost by cooking the steak for longer. Of course each temperature has its own distinct flavor but I do not feel that a properly prepared welldone steak sacrifices much if any flavor. The same goes for texture if prepared properly. That said in general I prefer my food cooked all the way through. When I cut into a rare steak and am greeted with a brightred gush of raw beef and bloodlike juice I completely lose my appetite. Presentation is important when eating such an expensive meal. Finally a fully cooked steak reduces the probability of picking up a foodborne illness. So its a win anyway you cut it pardon the pun. Why there shouldnt be a stigma around ordering welldone steak First of all Im the customer and its my money. I have heard that some restaurants not all obviously might give you a worse cut of meat if you ask for it cooked welldone. This is unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of a clientfocused food service industry where the customer orders and pays for a meal and the restaurant delivers. If restaurants or chefs are unwilling to start with the same quality ingredients for all orders regardless of specific customer requests then they should expressly forbid such orders on the menu so that customers with particular preferences can choose to dine elsewhere. I used to work in a restaurant not a steakhouse though and am never adversarial towards a server so I should expect the same when I am a customer.

',\n 'The success we keep hearing about in private schools is overhyped. Instead of privatizing education we should be focusing on how to reform the public system. I went to private schools all my life. I still go to one. The endless tales of bad teachers that we hear about in public schools can be accompanied by an equally long list of bad private school teachers. Let add to the pot of bad teacher stories In th grade I had trouble writing. The private school my parents paid well over year in tuition couldnt even tell me what was wrong. When we changed schools we found out what the issue was. When I was in th grade my math teacher moved to fast for me. I had to take an extra class from the learning support specialist which was effectively my math class. I also had to take a hristian studies course. When I asked the teacher questions such as If God is omnipresent why is he spaceless and timeless? I was given a vague answer. Any student who asked a hard question was given an unhelpful answer though that might be a problem with religion rather than with private schools. It wasnt an honest and objective analysis of hristianity rather it was a circlejerk of God is Great! Or Praise Jesus! I couldve used that time more effectively with the learning support specialist. In th grade my math teacher was incompetent beyond words. Literally all the parents and students hated her. The only reason that amalgamation of cells was ever hired was because school policy required that both the husband and wife be employees at the school. She started off each morning with a prayer which she couldve used as time to help struggling students. Instead of helping struggling students she would talk about her kids proselytize during class or make us ask our peers. She also made me take a test when I was jetlagged. Again the learning support specialist had to pick up the slack. Then theres my personal favorite of these stories from her she made the Asian kids teach for her. Funny thing is we couldve been spared from her. There was an applicant whose qualifications went beyond an accounting degree and having an SO who got a job at the same establishment. The reason he wasnt hired? He was agnostic. Instead of caring about the students the school cared about an agenda. I had to take that hristian studies course again in th grade and we were shown a video from Ben Steins Expelled and they contested evolution in that class. Im okay with the Bible being taught as mythology but to challenge scientific fact is utter bullshit. In my th grade year there a someone in my grade whose parents were getting a divorce. He became depressed. The school which practically made us memorize the sermon on the mount decided that the most hristlike action possible was to suspend him. What good what that have done? He wouldve been brought closer to the divorce. The divorce is what made him depressed in the first place. Thats what Jesus would do? I think what Jesus would do is get the hell away from the school campus. In my th grade year there was a band teacher who had an ego bigger than ount Everest. He made all the band students play in his goodbye concert. There was one kid who had to attend a funeral which happened to be on the same day as the ego concert. This guys hristlike action? He threatened to FAIL the kid if he didnt go to the concert. Through all these examples Ive shown that teachers can be just as incompetent and egotistical as public school teachers. Whatever bureaucracy plagues public schools can be replaced by even worse teaching standards. ',\n 'It is natural for people to be averse to the idea of eugenics. The belief that some people constitute better biological stock than others is hard to swallow we do not choose our genes and none of us like the idea of choices being made by others for our own supposed benefit. We believe that we have a right to reproduce a right to bodily autonomy that precludes government control of reproduction. Our individualist society places ultimate worth in the individual no matter how beneficial something may be for the collective it is wrong if it infringes on the rights of the individual. This is faulty reasoning and an indication that we are out of touch with reality. The individual does not exist we are continuously and overwhelmingly shaped by external forces outside of our control our genetic code our upbringing in childhood the societies in which we live. In turn our actions shape the genetic makeup of the future shape the future families and societies. This being realized it is clear that to place the individual above all else is to suppose that each individuals selfinterested actions will eventually benefit the collective as a whole. Adam Smith called this the invisible hand Of course Smith was referring solely to economic growth patterns which are not necessarily good indicators of true progress. One need only comprehend the devastation wrought upon the Earth as a consequences of the Industrial Revolution to see that economic growth may not be a good thing after all. Throughout history we have been shown that in a competitive individualized society that to which we are all entitled quickly becomes degraded Which brings me to my point something to which every individual feels entitled is the production of children. We shudder at the thought of someone other than ourselves controlling our prospective children. We can see no reason for another entity to restrict our ability to reproduce. However such reasons do exist and they are quite powerful. Among these are . The introduction of a child into the world is a fundamentally violent action. Parents do not ask for consent when they have children they are forcing the world to accommodate the presence of their child. All parents hope that their children will become self sufficient and ultimately benefit the world around them but clearly this is not the case. . It has long been known that less intelligent people have more children This inverse relationship between IQ and fertility has worried scientists since industrialization in the th century. It has been shown that IQ is largely heritable gt with the conclusion being that the Flynn Effect is a phenotypic consequence of better nutrition that masks our steady downward spiral of genotypic intelligence . Not only are less intelligent people predisposed towards having more children but our society encourages diversion from intellectual pursuits. The explosion of mass media and popular culture is very troubling the average American spends hours a day watching television We have entered an age where selection for beneficial traits has reached an all time low and so has selection against deleterious traits. Plastic surgery infertility treatment deodorant simple and repetitive jobs the welfare state makeup and fashion lack of disease and natural predators the list goes on. Now more than ever there exist a multitude of forces that accommodate genetic weakness and allow these individuals to reproduce with the same vigor as those who are more genetically fit. . The world is experiencing a real crisis of of overpopulation and consequential deterioration of the natural and built environment. It is said that education will lead to lower fertility of course I agree with this! And that is precisely the problem the educated and intelligent people decide to have fewer children. Those who are unintelligent either through lack of education or lack of aptitude will always have more children if it is in their self interest to do so. The potential economic worth of a child is hard to overstate when one is living in poverty. To summarize my points I believe that when an individual makes their contribution to the gene pool of the future by reproducing they are perpetuating their own genetic deficiencies to the detriment of not only their descendants but those who will live with their descendants. Note that I would never suggest that genetically weak people be killed. They deserve all the compassion that we should grant to any individual. It is this compassion that I feel towards future unborn individuals that leads me to believe that eugenics is necessary. Human civilization has reached a point where natural selection no longer favors intelligent cooperative sociable and moral individuals. It is a world where anonymity and division of labor have enabled the potential for everyone to survive and have children. But such survival is not thriving! The value of a population is measured in its quality not its quantity. With dysgenic freereproduction there is very little that encourages high quality low quantity births and very little that discourages low quality high quantity births. As to how such eugenic goals may be realized I point to hina for inspiration Incentives for individuals to have few children is the first step. Once the total birthrate has become low enough to maintain a stable population measures can be taken to improve genetic structure of future born children. These might involve extensive sperm amp eggs banks where individuals identified as genetically fit i.e. high IQ noncriminal genuinely altruistic physically wellformedhealthy could supply the majority of new children. People on the lower end of the genetic spectrum could still raise children provided they pass certain testsbackground checks ensuring that they will not be abusive and corrupting. I propose all people pass these tests to qualify as adoptive parents even genetically fit individuals I foresee that responses will suggest that I am placing too much concern on heredity that is I am giving undue weight to nature over nurture. To this I contend that we often underestimate the power of heredity. Of course all humans share common ancestors if you go back far enough. It is generally accepted that we all came from the same initial genetic stock But the reality is that our physical manifestation is determined mostly by the genetic structures of our parents and our environment in the womb infancy and early childhood. Our brains are physical organs whose physical form is determined almost entirely by genes. People have long recognized the importance of the brain and many attempted to physically deform the brain for mystical or social reasons. Heredity is recognized as the major determining component in intelligence among other behavioral aspects If you wish to change my view you will have to convince me that . Dysgenic collapse is not only not imminent but impossible. I see no difference between it happening years from now or a thousand or even a million. The threat of its occurrence must be dealt with at some point. . Individualist and free society where no government oversight over reproduction exists can counter dysgenic trends of its own accord. Show me that people are willing to embrace technology that will rewrite the genetic codes of fetuses rendering concerted naturalreproduction eugenicist efforts unnecessary. . That a future with dysgenic collapse a la Idiocracy is not necessarily a bad thing so long as an elite exists that will take care of the unwittingly enslaved humans. I look forward to seeing some responses soon.',\n 'This question has been asked before but I havent found someone asking the question with the same view that I have. I feel like people dont deserve to have money in our society if they dont put forth anything that makes our society prosper. Just because you exist doesnt mean that you deserve the money that someone else earned through working more or working harder than you did. This currently exists to a much lesser extent with welfare but thats unfortunately necessary because some people are trying to find a job or just cant support a family which if they knew that they wouldnt make enough money to support one anyways then they shouldnt have had kids. Instead of just giving people tax money why dont we put money towards infrastructure that helps people make money through working? i.e. schools for education factories for uneducated workers etc. Also when the U.S is in trillion in debt I dont think the proper investment with our money is to just hand it to people. The people you give the money to will still not be skillededucated enough to get a better job to help our economy. It would only make us go into more debt. So .

Then the lead singer has an existential crisis dissolves the band and takes down the website making it impossible for new fans to find their albums.

But I do think that the distinction between the two and the fact that some countries swear by British spelling and make you change your automatic spell checker and write all your papersessaysadvertisementswhatever in this spelling is pointless. There is not enough of a difference between the two and we should rather let them naturally merge into one. I admit Im not sure how this would happen.

',\n 'First of all I myself am a teenage girl and I have a very close relationship with my parents and I feel safe and trust them talking to them about sexual activities as I know they are more experienced than me. I would consider myself more independent compared to other teenage girls however I believe that research is required before making decisions such as birth control. I believe that teenage girls are first of all not mature enough to have a well researched or experience say in their sex lives. Their parents have gone through decisions like these and if teenage girls do not have the ability to trust their parents then they do not have the ability to trust their own decisions. Especially since birth control involves potential health risks that teenage girls may not be aware of increasingly validates the point that teenage girls should talk to their parents before deciding whether or not they should take birth control pills. Another point is that I believe if teens were given the ability to take birth control without the consent of their parents they would be increasingly prone to chances of obtaining sexually transmitted diseases. To prevent this teenagers should talk to their parents about possible health risks involved with taking birth control pills. However being a teenage girl myself I feel that my opinions are not well researched and do not consider the statuses of other teenage girls within their families. I would really appreciate it if you guys could contribute your opinion and expand my knowledge on the issue. ',\n 'What someone else masturbates to and how much they do it as long as it doesnt involve disturbing others i.e. masturbating in a public place is their business. People have every right masturbate to whatever they like no matter how objectionable that content could be as long they do not commit immoral actions in the real world. For example masturbating to someones picture on Facebook as long as the person doing it does not disturb the other person by telling them about it is perfectly acceptable. asturbating to thoughts of friends is likewise acceptable. I anticipate this will be a common reply so let me state that I do not think childporn should be legal. aking it by definition involves the exploitation of children. However I do not think that masturbating to thoughts of children or even to pornography of children is in itself an objectionable thing to do. If someone has pedophiliac desires then they have every right to deal with them in a way that does not harm anyone else. ',\n 'Because my idea of beating the customers silly seems to be unpopular... If the sign says items and you bring you should be assessed a dollar fee. bucks for every item over . If a register scans a th item automatic bucks. th? Another . And so on. Post signs dont hide it in the fine print. As I see it this would affect people that cant count and thus probably shouldnt be in the supermarket unattended to anyways. People that dont care enough to count their items well maybe this will start speeding up the process. Assholes who dont care about anyone else fuck them anyways. I really dont see a downside to this. ',\n 'Death with dignity is a bogus political slogan even more misleading than prolifeprochoice. Death is antithetical to dignity. No matter how broken or disgusting your body has become it will be even worse after death. Youre not preserving anything by choosing to die. There is dignity in choosing to live even though death would solve your problems. Living with extreme pain proves your strength. hoosing death over disability is insulting to other people who choose to live with their disabilities. Death is the enemy of humanity. Death is the embodiment of evil. hoosing death is siding with death which means taking a stand against humanity. In short choosing death means choosing the easy way out. Dying isnt easy but its easier than living with your problems. Note that Im talking about assisted suicide which is often billed as death with dignity. This is about people choosing death not having death chosen for them. Being murdered or dying in an accident or dying to save someone else can be dignified but suicide cannot. Im not here to say you shouldnt be allowed to choose suicide. Im just saying its not in any way dignified. ',\n 'This is an opinion of mine that most people seem to disagree with so maybe I need to be convinced. . What is a successful species? A successful species is the one that exploits its environment most efficiently. Growth general reproductive success is a response to an exploitation of the environment. As such humans are the most successful large animal species on Earth. I dont think human beings should sacrifice some of this success for the environment. No other animal would selfinflict population control. . The inherent value of the environment. This touches on whether the environment is worth preserving or not. As a species were at a point where we depend on the environment for survival. Therefore the environment has utility. The environment also has aesthetic value for most people. . Is there a moral obligation to sustain the environment? No. This is a whole different but I dont think morality is the ideal method of determining whether or not a populationsociety should do anything. On an individual basis morality is useful but it has extreme subjectivity. I feel that although not perfect utility is often the more reliable system for societies. No system of value will avoid subjectivity and all can be twisted in the same way. . y point. I use the word necessarily in the title because if the solutions we develop allow us to continue to exploit the environment in order to support the growth of our species then so be it. I dont believe however that the environment on Earth will be able to support the growth of humanity indefinitely. Therefore a more ideal solution is to create synthetic solutions. I dont think its TOO far fetched to imagine generators creating the perfect atmosphere for human growth synthetic food being healthier and tasting better than traditional food sources. Gardens in place for aesthetic purposes. I know this is probably a very scatteredincoherent point of view Im still thinking about it. In any case thanks for reading and if you can. ',\n 'Idk.

',\n 'I am proposing that New York be split into two states to ensure political fairness and to lower taxes in the northern region. Under this proposal the northern and southern portions of New York would be separated. Long Island New York ity the boroughs Queens Brooklyn the Bronx anhattan and Staten Island and Westchester ounty would belong to one state whereas all NY counties north of Westchester would be considered another. Albany would remain the capital of the northern region and anhattan would become the capital of the southern state. The state of New York is considered to be a blue state. However one may find that the geographic majority of New York is actually conservative. While New York being considered a blue state accounts for the majority of the people living in it it excludes the vast geographic majority. This is due to the fact that southern New York is very population dense. There are . million people living in the state of New York. . million people live in New York ity . million people on Long Island and a little over people living in Westchester ounty. This means that out of the . million people in the state . million people make up a region of square miles NY as a whole minus the regions I described above. The liberal south of the state is deciding how the many conservative areas are run. A resident of Long Island or NY may find it dangerous and unnecessary to own a gun. However youre likely to find signs that blatantly oppose the New York S.A.F.E Act The political atmosphere of the geographic majority of New York is very different from that of the populous majority. Dividing the state in two would allow for the two regions to make political decisions that respect their populations. urrently the rich liberals in New York ity and its surrounding areas neglect the rest of the state. This would not be an issue if decisions made in Albany the state capital affected the nearby counties and not those hours away with a different atmosphere and different views. The different areas have different needs lets serve them better. Taxes are also high in New York as is the cost of living. This once again is likely due to the fact that the standard of living in most of New York ity Long Island and Westchester is ridiculously high. In Westchester and Long Island you have your stereotypical white uppermiddle class picketfence families. In New York ity you have the city that never sleeps a global economic driving force. As a result people in the more rural parts of New York face harsh taxes since these people make up a majority of the state. By isolating the people of the southern region the northerners would pay reasonable taxes while the southerners would pay appropriate taxes. Those who cant afford it or those who choose to pay lower taxes may want to move to the northern state. I believe that the northern regions economy could be managed with the help of metropolitan areas such as Albany Syracuse Utica Buffalo and Ithaca. There are also many universities in these areas many public schools and more than enough private schools that would continue to stimulate the economy. The southern region would have no problem sustaining itself. But I could be completely wrong. .

What I mean when I say they should function as stop signs is that one should be able to stop observe the intersection and if it is clear proceed with caution similar to how right turns on red are currently executed. This would increase efficiency when driving without sacrificing safety very much IO. I feel like when I drive there are a vast number of occasions when it would be completely safe for me to go through the intersection but its technically illegal until the light turns green. Im sure the majority of other drivers experience similar situations. This wastes everyones time and even money gas is burned while idling. This is especially true in the middle of night when there are times when youre the only vehicle on the road where youre driving. This obviously wouldnt work at every intersection as some intersections just have too much traffic going in too many directions so heres my disclaimer that I agree there are exceptions. However I do think these intersections could have a no turn on red from A P or something rather than a hard rule. I see signs like this in the city all the time. This way when there is no traffic at A people arent just idling at red lights for minutes. The only hard exception I can think of is one where visibility is significantly limited and it is difficult or impossible to tell if another vehicle is entering the intersection.

Ive come to the conclusion that there are possible scenarios and rules for the Genies powers but both have some significant flaws in them. Scenario The Genies powers only activate when his master wishes for something. Excluding songs and dances and things of that nature the Genie can only have legitimate power if his master wishes for it. This makes sense in that the Genie requires that his freedom be wished for in order for him to be free. The problem with this is that the Genie was able to get himself Aladdin and company outside of the ave of Wonders without it counting as one of Aladdins wishes. In this case it seems the Genie has unlimited power but is constrained to fulfill whatever wishes his master desires which brings us to... Scenario Genie can do what he wants but must follow his masters wishes. lets also assume that the Genie cannot free himself In this case the Genie lives his life as he chooses but just wants freedom so he doesnt have to fulfill a random guys wishes. The problem with this then is when Aladdin was handcuffed and drowning why did Genie require Aladdin to wish for himself to be saved? Why wouldnt the Genie just save him using his own relatively free will? In either of these situations why didnt the Genie just strike up a deal with Aladdin that if Aladdin wished for the Genies freedom instantly once the Genie was free the Genie could just provide Aladdin with wishes as if he were the Genies master? This is something that is such a critical part in the plot of the movie that really needs clarifying for me to enjoy the film fully. ',\n 'This is something I used to go back and forth on with an ex.

Since its always been a very interesting topic to me and she never succeeded in changing my view on it I thought Id bring it here to discuss. y view is that all actions are selfserving and that altruism is no exception. I dont see that as a bad thing but people who like to think of themselves as altruists seem to get offended by the idea and rail against it. Selfserving isnt evil. But Zero one might ask how would a soldier throwing himself on a grenade be selfserving? Truly that is an altruistic action! It is and I dont think its anything less than it is. But that soldier would do so because in so doing they fulfill some moral obligation they hold themselves to. It is in adherence with who they wish to be and through action serves to make it so. It also bears noting that this isnt something I assert necessarily. That is I dont point it out to people as a counter to their claim of being altruistic. The topic only even came about as a result of discussing the view that all actions are selfserving. What about altruistic actions? Well yes those too in their way. Less dire a person may give to charity or the homeless for a desire to see good done or because they feel that because they have plenty themselves they should share what they can because theyre good people. Its a behavior which serves to maintain their selfimage. ',\n 'Okay its over you can quit downvoting now. fucking christ First of all Im not conservative and I dont hate women. Im not religious and I voted for Obama lol. At first I was upset. You know the usual Dont use your religion to take away our rights. Plus its important women have access to birth control. Only recently did I learn that Hobby Lobbys policy covers types of birth control ranging from ondoms to the daily pill. The only types of birth control they do not want to pay for are emergency contraceptives the morning after pill and IUDs for some reason. While I dont understand the IUD part maybe one of you can explain it to me better I find the emergency contraceptive part reasonable. y partner and I have needed to use Plan B before. Its a life saver. Its also only about dollars. If you cant afford a dollar pill that will save you from having kids you probably shouldnt be having sex. Plus Planned Parenthood bless their souls provide what they can to those financially lacking. hange my view. Giving it to this person. If I was religious Id probably be able to argue more but utheanswerisfortytwo did a damn good job.  I guess I just wish people would be more careful especially if they cant afford kids in the first place. Ideally everyone would have a lot more personal responsibility but its not like taking away their avenues of aid is going to help anybody.',\n 'Hey guys. So first of all I wouldnt go as far as to say that I think the term overrated is meaningless. I think I understand exactly what people mean when they say it. I just dont personally find myself using it or thinking of something as being overrated because of the way that I think about art and media and I wish more people could see things the way I do. But Im looking for someone to shed some light on what they think overrated means because maybe Im taking it to an extreme that others are not. What I mean is generally when people say something is overrated they mean this is critically acclaimed or appreciated by a huge number of people but I dont like it. Therefore I dont understand why so many people like it or I do not think it deserves the praise it gets. I personally do not believe in superlatives or assigning greatness to something that is purely subjective. I am a huge movie buff as some of you might know but I dont have a personal list of greatest movies because I dont think you can rank movies based on which is best since everyone has different criteria. However if you asked me what the greatest movie ever is I might say ERTIGO or ITIZEN KANE because there is a consensus among critics that it is either one of those two movies. Therefore when I say ERTIGO is the greatest I am NOT stating an opinion I am referring to the consensus of the canon of film criticism. I think greatest in these sense refers to most influential or most written about or most often said to be the best by people who are in the business of saying such things in which case greatest film could be an objective label because I think influence and popularity are objective qualities as opposed to the subjective act of enjoying something. I dont think there is necessarily one film that is OST influential but it is inarguable that some films are just more influential than others. Lets move on to the Beatles we all know that time and time again on itll come up that someone thinks the Beatles are overrated. I think based on my criteria for greatness the Beatles are certainly great. It is hard to ignore the impact they had on pop culture and pop music and they are undeniably legendary and wellcited in literature and criticism and not without reason. When you say the Beatles are overrated youre saying either I dont like the greatest band of all time so how can they be the greatest? or because I dont like them they shouldnt have been the greatest band. The former statement is going against my own interpretation of what people mean by greatest as I said before. You are allowed to dislike the Beatles but still understand that they had this great impact. The second statement whether they deserved to have had that impact is prententiously insisting that your sole opinion is the only correct one. Rather than try to do research and understand the impact the Beatles had and figure out why they are called great you just kind of gave up and decided that you HAD to like them or they are automatically overrated. I think the problem is that people see things or listen to things called the greatest and assume it means that it is going to be the thing they enjoy the most. They hear that ITIZEN KANE is the greatest film of all time and think well that means that if I watch it I will have the most enjoyable experience I have ever had watching a movie. But ITIZEN KANE is considered great for reasons that are not readily apparent to the average modern viewer. Its basically the equivalent of a hris Nolan film groundbreaking practical special effects yes theyre so good that I bet most of you are scratching your heads wondering what effects Im even referring to temporally complex narrative technical innovation incredible camerawork makeup and a young and spirited director at the helm. Its great in its historical context but its also great because critics decided it was great and it became a sort of cultural meme that everyone just assumes is true. If you wanted to say ITIZEN KANE is overrated because I have done extensive research and study and have written a peerreviewed critical analysis demonstrating how it did not really have the great influence and impact that it had something people have done then you would be going somewhere. But if you said ITIZEN KANE is overrated because I didnt like it you are misunderstanding what is meant by great and you are too lazy to do the research to see why it earns that label. Ultimately youre just missing out on a chance to enrich your cultural understanding and find out why things are beloved in their context even if you dont personally care for it. Personally I have never found a single thing to be overrated because even things I dislike I understand WHY they are liked and why they are influential because I am interested and invested in understanding popular culture. I know that not everyone is as into it as I am but if youre not why even make the criticism to begin with? And if youre posting to saying something is overrated because you want to understand it why not say I dont understand why people like this rather than make the presumptuous statement that implies other people are wrong for liking it? .

Synesthesia certainly exists but I believe its importance has been overblown by people who want to be special snowflakes. Everyone experiences synesthesia. Ive never met anyone who upon first learning of the phenomenon didnt claim to have experienced it. I too have experienced it. Its a natural common experience just like all the other shit our brains do on a daily basis. Brains are all about making connections. Synesthesia is just our brains making connections between different sense memories. I would be more surprised if anyone claimed to experience all senses in their pure forms i.e. without association to any other sense. Some people give vivid descriptions of their synesthesic experiences making them sound much more powerful than anything Ive experienced. You might be tempted to say they have true synesthesia like its condition whereas I have only experienced a mild form comparable to the difference between being depressed and sad. I propose two alternate explanations. First these people are probably attention whores. Second if their descriptions are accurate then they probably result from some alternate condition like schizophrenia which enhances all their senses. Some people talk about their synesthesia nonstop even its most mundane forms. For instance I knew a guy who told everyone what color they were to him to me this is as bullshit as being told the color of my aura. Again I think these people are just attention whores. Its like describing your dreams we all have weird dreams that are meaningful and supernatural and fascinating to ourselves but its just your brains white noise and it doesnt make you special. We should not entertain these peoples narcissism its unhealthy. So there you have it. I believe synesthesia is common and mundane and the people who claim they have it are just trying to be unique. hange that view.

I always assumed that this was correct and if I went on the subreddit I would find this kind of material. However when I went on the subreddit all the posts were actually completely reasonable and not bigoted at all. I mean one of the top posts of all time is a quote from a feminist and another one is a picture of a post from a feminist blog After spending half an hour on the subreddit I couldnt find anything bigoted or offensive and although I recognize that there are probably people on there who do hate women they are actually quite hard to find. There are no jokes about feminism or womens rights which are actually quite frequent outside of the subreddit. Honestly youre much more likely to find a sexist comment browsing rfunny than you are browsing ensRights. I get that the mistreatment of women is a larger problem than the mistreatment of men but this doesnt mean the mistreatment of men isnt a problem. It isnt as big of a problem and so theres much less activism which is fine but I dont think people should be criticized for participating in that activism. ',\n 'Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing . Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. . It is an integral part of a relationship so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. . By treating it as just another activity to enjoy it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust communication emotional intimacy etc. I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus we should reduce the value of sex in society. !',\n 'A zerosum game is a situation in which a participants gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other participant.

I feel as though a lot of people are attracted to a certain musician or a certain artist for hisher unique sound. There are so many types of artists making so many different types of music. Time and time again artists will switch up their sound to appeal to a different crowd. Theyll often claim its something they were personally connected to and wanted to do. But I think its a slap in the face to all of the fans theyve acquired. I think that if you create a sound and it works and people are buying into it you shouldnt switch it. Theres nothing more annoying than when I voice my dislike for the new direction an artist is going in and some of hisher bitter fans jump on the bandwagon and say I dont appreciate it.

People arent naturally talented at anything the people that excel in musicartwhatever are the ones who have been practising for years not because they were born with some extra ability that others havent got. It may be true that they started learning from a young age and therefore it seems like they are talented but that is just that they started early. I think it is somewhat different with sport since genes do influence someones strength and agility but I am focusing on more mental sorts of skill like music acting art... Anyway I think you get the point. Skills in certain areas are ones you accumulate not ones you are born with. . In actual fact the point I wanted to make is that when a friend does something well like play the piano they shouldnt be congratulated for having talent since that assumes too much. Saying that they have talent assumes that they were born above everyone else and are especially cut out for this activity. Rather we should congratulate them for hard work not assuming that they are special. If I then find out that they had only heard the piece they had just played once and then did a stunning performance that is when they should be told they have talent.

',\n 'Hi rchangemyview. Im sure many of you are familiar with the subreddit rtumblrinaction. Im posting here because I dont really get why so many seem to like it. I feel like Im going crazy here because I just realized that the sub has so many of the same qualities as rshitredditsays a sub that I really dislike. I want help to reconcile these differences. Some things I noticed Hyperbole and misrepresentation. Obviously its a circlejerk sub but I really feel like people there actually believe what they say about what feminists believe. I lurk rfemradebates a lot and have learned a lot about both R and feminism there and have noticed a huge disconnect between whats said there and what people circlejerk about in TiA. What TiA says about feminists is like what SRS says about RAs. Outrage culture. Its been getting really bad there lately.. it used to be pretty chill but people are getting so angry and worked up that it feels really toxic now. I browse rtiadiscussion and a lot of people seem to agree. There was even a sticky mod post about how to deal with rage...  issing sarcasmobvious jokes and circlejerking about the opposition anyways. SRS does this a lot with regards to RAs and they get a lot of flak rightfully for it. But then I see things like this on the front page of TiA  and am starting to think that you can post almost anything fake from Tumblr to circlejerk about. Starting to attract actual bigots. SRS can get really bad with the actual communists eg. aoStalin apologists and that sucks. Im a uslim and I really hate how Tumblr tries to speak on our behalf but I hate Islamophobes way more. Threads like this  were really disheartening to me especially because the article itself was so sensationalist and pretty much made shit up. I had the OP of that thread tagged as an Islamophobic white nationalist before so it sucks to see that actual bigots can get away with using the sub as a political soapbox. Plus the whole chan vs. Tumblr thing showed that there were a lot of chan.orgpol users there.. a place thats legitimately fucked up. Touching the poop. SRS likes to see themselves as the white knights of reddit who like to call out reddit but TiA is starting to act like ShitTumblrSays more and more. Its supposed to be a humor sub not the sub that keeps watch over the shit that Tumblrinas say. This one feels so weird... people are even starting to act like the Tumblr police  thats just what SRS likes to do too when they cry to the reddit admins??? This last one is really petty but I feel like the cult of personality around the mods has been getting a bit over the top. The mods of TiA are treated like the archangelles of SRS... its really weird to me. I thought about this for awhile and I first thought that one major difference between the two subreddits is that TiA doesnt ban anybody with a different opinion like SRS does. But when I thought about it some more I realized that since SRS is so unpopular and TiA is so popular that TiA doesnt need any mod enforcement to make the sub a circlejerk. I remember seeing someone try to support Affirmative Action on the sub and they got hammered with downvotes even when they were being completely reasonable. this part made the thread go in a direction i didnt care about so Im removing it tldr Im starting to dislike TiA because its become like a mirror of rshitredditsays. Please convince me where Im wrong! It just feels really weird to laugh at SRS types when the sub acts just like them. ',\n 'This video explains it as simply as I have seen it explained thus far although admittedly it is biased The Jews stole the land off of the Palestinians in the first half of the th century. Now all these years later Israel is happy to give Palestine large segments of their own land on the condition of peace while Palestine still wants nothing more than to destroy Israel. While I agree that it is only natural to want land back that was taken forcibly from you it seems that supporters of Palestine dont understand that dissolving an entire nation and its citizens for the sake of a historical grudge just cant happen in this modern world. Yes it was terrible how the land was taken from them but as so many others have pointed out it was also terrible how the land was taken from the native Americans yet surely everyone understands the issues that would arise if the entire continent was suddenly given back to native Americans. Instead Palestine seems to be getting enormous support from much of the world in their plight to sacrifice millions of lives in this bid to reclaim what they feel is theirs. If the identity of an entire states citizens is taken away from them resulting in more violence and refugees so that Palestine gets some land back so be it right? I want to side with Palestine given the continually dire situation they are in and the amount of oppression they are subjected to but this is all created by a war that seems entirely motivated by their own people. Why is there so much support for Palestine given that they seem to be the warmongers? ',\n 'As western societies have modernized and industrialized they have slowly begun shedding oldfashioned social taboos that never really made much sense in the first place. For example sexism or the notion that women have no place in the public sectors of business and government and racism or the idea that different people are automatically born to menial positions in society because of the color of their skin. Just in very recent years people have finally begun getting past homophobia or the notion that gay lesbian and transgender people should be denied rights and considerations which heterosexual people take for granted. But one area where oldfashioned social taboos are still relatively untouched is the area of dress codes. We judge one another based on how we dress and we do so for the stupidest reasons. As the wiki explains That doesnt tell you the half of it. Judgments about clothing are inflexible and automatic with no appeal. For instance if I were to go into work next week and announce that I have decided that I am a woman I am a man my colleagues would be supportive enthusiastic and curious. However if I came to work wearing a dashiki and a kufi they would assume I had lost my mind. If I came to work wearing a cape underwear and cowboy boots I might face termination. The consequences of stepping outside accepted dress codes can be severe and nobody thinks twice about the prejudices and odd assumptions that underlie our attitudes about clothing. In certain fields for example business and law failure of men to wear the standard western business suit or women to wear the ondoleezastyle western pantsuit can have dire if unofficial consequences. However talented or hardworking or good at your job you might be you can quickly find yourself essentially ostracized disrespected by your employers clients and colleagues mocked and driven out of the profession. Almost exactly like a termite with foreign pheromones your colleagues will turn on you and eat you alive. For fun heres the famous scene in American Psycho that brilliantly satirizes our obsession with dress and dress codes. TLDR for all of western cultures progress in terms of getting rid of old prejudices western dress codes are almost absurdly driven by social prejudice and fear of what is strange unusual or different. Theres no actual benefit to having such inflexible dress codes and therefore this needs to change. . ',\n 'Aside from my initial problem of it being whitedefault and everything else colored which to me seems worse than not white at least thats just an objective fact that can be meant to be shitily colored just sounds wrong to me But it also seems inherently western centric.

Has the connentation changed to where being chinese is the default and everyone else is a PO including white people? or are they considered PO in their own country?

In order to inquire about who we feel should be voted for we must know who out there exists. Therefore we rely heavily on marketing campaigns to inform us of the individuals who are running. What this ends up doing is it makes it so the few people in the population of the country are eligible to run because they are the few who can raise the funds required for costly campaigns. Even after we have been informed about the candidates running we are forced as a nation to come together and debate for ourselves what we think about the information given.

The first thing that comes to mind might be millions of people collecting to forums would take an excessive amount of resources to cater to. Yes that is true. It is hard to imagine a single staff working for a politician to be able to cater to the demand of people inquiring. However if the money spent on ad campaigns was instead directed to hiring staff members to speak on the politicians behalf then they could essentially train and employ enough people to take a huge chunk of the inquiries being thrown at them. If a movement were started that could get the majority of the population to agree to only vote for candidates who participate in open discussion forums then I feel we the people would be more likely to choose candidates whos best interests are out for the people and not for the corporations who support the funding behind their ad campaigns.

',\n 'This centers around the current situation surrounding disposable cutlery in Western nations wherein we spend precious resources on making oneuse plastic cutlery which is disposed of immediately after a meal. This is also a big issue in eastern Asia where disposable chopsticks are consumed at an alarming rate. I think we should return to the system of medieval Europe where people brought a knife for eating wherever they went and while eating out there would be no expectation for the host to provide cutlery. This could be done easily with either a hybrid of a forkknifespoon or simply bringing several tools for the job. A nondisposable pair of chopsticks would be even easier to bring with you too. This would also be a boon for hygiene as every person would be responsible for keeping their set of cutlery clean preferably with some type of paper napkin to rub over with after a meal. A common counterargument I get is about where one would carry the cutlery especially for men who tend to not bring handbags with them. But this is a non issue as there are are several foldable sporks on the market even today. I look forward to hearing possible counterarguments to my view.',\n 'Hey . So far when it comes to changing my view you guys are so I figured Id post another opinion of mine. In general I am pretty accepting of other peoples views but I absolutely cannot stand pacifists.

I mean people with the specific mindset that violence is always wrong and stooping to it makes you as bad as your enemies. Theyre weak pathetic spineless cowards that would rather lay down and die than fight to defend themselves. And at least on some level all of them are pretty much hypocrites. Sure r. Amish Guy its really easy to talk about how unnecessary violence is when you live in America and have the entire US army to defend your worthless ass! Try pulling that crap down in artel exico or maybe Warzone Africa and see how it works. Ive never once heard of a pacifist compound surviving completely independently without any cops or soldiers to defend their retarded philosophy. The thing is I dont like having this reflexive disdain for any group of people. I normally hate guys who are willing to just write people off because of their views but I cant help it in this case. Please show me the worth of pacifism as a belief. ',\n 'Note Let me preface by saying that I realize this viewpoint has been discussed on this subreddit before but I dont feel like it expanded the discussion enough. In any case those threads are dead and difficult to revive. There are new points that I would like to bring up. For the most part this concept is only discussed in politics but I would like to shift the discussion away from politics as much as possible. I think this problem exists in social media on a complicated level that we havent fully defined yet. I really hope someone here is able to put what I am attempting to describe in better words than I can or help me understand if Im missing something. The definition of satire is the use of humor irony exaggeration or ridicule to expose and criticize peoples stupidity or vices particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. T shows such as SNL The olbert Report and South Park use excessive satire usually to prove a point that is part of the creators belief system. Let me point out that satire is a beautiful thing that helps us understand others beliefs in an entertaining way but I think it has gotten to a point where it is more damaging than progressive. T shows like South Park and The Daily Show have been on air for nearly years. hildren of the late s and early s have been subjected to heavy amounts of satire from childhood and into adulthood. As a result I believe that satire has become so heavily ingrained into the brains of emerging adults that it is having very negative sideeffects. These sideeffects are making it cool to hate. I see so many examples of this throughout social media. For some reason and I dont know why it is considered cool to hate the actor Nicolas age. Through social media and online memes these strange ideas have spread. Suddenly many people of the younger generation decide to bash Nicolas age and claim he is a terrible actor with complete ignorance or reasoning. We see the same thing happen with many other celebrities as well. But okay Nic age is just a celebrity and it shouldnt matter right? But I cant help but see this blind hate emerging everywhere. It extends itself to stereotypes as well and this is where I draw the line. I believe it has gotten to the point where it becomes cool to hate women. It becomes cool to hate hipsters. It even becomes cool to hate different websites such as Facebook Reddit or Twitter. The reason I believe this is a problem is because it promotes a lot of ignorant and aimless negative thought. And I understand that it has always been cool to hate in one form or another but nowadays we are subjected to it in our Facebook feeds on our mobile phones in our music everywhere. This hate surrounds us so much that it becomes such a normal part of our day and is accepted as okay. The worst part about it all is that it doesnt promote healthy and thoughtful discussion. If someone is accused of satirical slander its easy for the accuser to avoid defending themselves by ridiculing or saying its only a joke calm down. There is truth in all jokes and I dont think it should be taken lightly in the world we live in today. Satire is manipulating truthful original and thoughtful discussion. The reason I posted here in the first place is because I know this subreddit doesnt tolerate the cool to hate mentality. It is all about progression and original thought. Im afraid I may be discussing two separate issues and I encourage others to help organize my thoughts. Im very interested in getting down to the core of this issue. I sure as hell hope someone can change my view because its leading me down a rabbit hole and Im seeing a dark and passiveaggressive future ahead of us. ',\n 'This is inspired by the Hobby Lobby case that granted religiouslymotivated corporations the right to opt out of providing birth control but it my argument also applies to other laws from which religious people are exempt such as peyote prohibition. Its pretty simple I believe laws should apply equally to everyone. Anything else is unfair. This is true regardless of how I feel about any particular law. I want all corporations to supply birth control but since the Supreme ourt has ruled that some dont I believe none should. Since the Hobby Lobby decisions applies to corporations its now creating unfair competition because religious companies can save money on insurance. Laws that affect actual people are even more important because thats discrimination. In the US your right to practice your religion is constitutionally protected and so is my right to not practice your religion. Yet if I want to take peyote the federal government has essentially said I must convert to a religion that allows it. The only exception Ive thought of is the taxexempt status of religious organizations. Personally I dont think they should be exempt at all but you can probably make a compelling argument in favor. However they could just be covered by the same laws as nonprofits without requiring their own special tax code.

',\n 'In a reddit comment a radiator argued that global warming was indeed terrible by pointing to this article about the potential disappearance of most polar bears. I believe that the potential disappearance of the polar bear is exactly as bad for my life as the disparition of the dodo bird which occurred around it has exactly zero impact. I have nothing against polar bears despite their being known to kill and sometimes eat humans wikipedia but I have no interaction with them. They do not produce anything that I need and I think most humans do not rely on the polar bear for anything. We should be concerned by zillions of other human problems before we even start thinking about doing anything to artificially save a population of polar bears. hange my view ',\n 'Im talking about the new ones not the classic ones.

',\n 'We should make welfare much harder to get because it is allowing large corporations to pay their employees an hour because they can go out and get welfare to supplement their income. I do think that it would get pretty bad for those people for a couple of years as businesses would be reluctant to raise wages but if we made welfare much much harder to be eligible for businesses would be forced to pay their employees more because without any kind of social programs to fall back on people simply couldnt work for the amount they are currently being paid. When I say that Welfare should be much harder to get Im talking about supplemental help not disability or anything like that. ',\n 'I do not see the appeal in ake whatever day it is.

Some employers will have a PTO bank for vacation days another one for sick days another one for personal days and another for floating holidays. Theres a lot of reasons I think this is worse than using a single combined PTO bank. The employee will have trouble calculating how much time is available to them. If the employer requires PTO to be used in hour chunks the actual amount of PTO available may be different from the useable amount of PTO available. Accounting on the employer side is complicated as there are going to be multiple ways of accounting for an employees day off. The various PTO banks usually accrue at different rates which makes it hard to estimate how much time off you will have in the future. The various PTO banks usually have different rules for how much time can be accumulated and whether or not it rolls over from year to year as well as how much can roll over each year. It encourages employees to lie which is bad for employee morale and bad for the company. Its better to know Fred will not be in a week ahead of time than for him to fake sick the morning of. Its disingenuous to offer a sick bank as employers typically act like its the same as vacation time when hiring you but its only supposed to be available if you are sick. I once was offered to leave a job with weeks PTO all one bank for a job with weeks PTO week vacation weeks sick and the recruiter tried to claim that it was just a semantic difference. In reality to use those weeks Id have to actually be sick or lie about it. And even if I did lie about it I couldnt use more than a day or two at a time unlike vacation time.

',\n 'Whenever I play a game like Wastelands or Xenonauts these are the two that spring to mind though Ive played others and finally get to the combat I feel like the game grinds to a halt. This happens with any sort of turn based combat in RPG games. I should point out that GrandStrategy games like iv or Total War are not what Im talking about here. The games themselves arent whats boring. I thought that the two I mentioned above had cool premises and were super detailed in lore two things I love about games. But when the combat started the nice flow that I had been experiencing stops. Ill try and list the things that bother me. . Action Points I get the reasoning behind them but they limit what I want to do so badly I want to throw my computer out the window. They simply seem unrealistic. . Enemies Perhaps its because I never played long enough to get better equipment but every time I play and try to attack I always miss at point blank range. However at yards the enemy seems to be a dead eye with every shot. . Turns Things will happen to my guys on an enemy turn that I cant react to like I would in Age of Empires ompany of Heroes etc... and it seems unrealistic. One time I was playing Xenonats and the aliens made one of my soldiers go nuts and started shooting everyone. IRL and in RTS games youd move your guys away and try to kill the crazed soldier but nope I had to sit there and watch three of my guys get slaughtered because it was the Enemy Turn. I know Ill probably get responses like Oh well you just havent played them enough or You sound like you dont know what youre doing. Which are both true but the games make me so mad that I dont want to even try and get better. In an RTS if I accidentally lose my tank to an enemy emplacement thats my fault and I should have been paying attention more to the situation. But it could have happened in a split second far to fast for me to react and that doesnt bother me because shit happens like that IRW all the time. In a turn based game if I miss it I have to sit there and watch helplessly as the enemy takes it out and I watch the camera hover over the wreckage as if to say Look dumbass ya coulda stopped it but you got too frustrated. I do really want to have my view changed on this. ',\n 'Stereotypes are often wrong but can contain a kernel of truth. IE inexperienced people are more likely to be clingy or weird about sex. Promiscuous people do tend to make less stable partners. Perhaps not true across cultures and populations but good rules of thumb in many places. It is completely okay to reject someone for their sexual history or habits. Not just for what someones history might indicate about them but also due to aesthetic preferences. If youre less attracted to someone after you learn theyve never had sex or theyve slept around a lot thats totally okay. Its completely okay for a guys to want a girl who is a virgin or who has only had one partner. Its also okay for a guy to want a bad bitch who is very promiscuous and experienced. It might not be fair but its life. It is not okay to shame or make people feel bad about their sexual past. However if hurt or shame occurs as a result of being rejected thats just tough luck. ',\n 'im coming here after a discussion i had on rpolitics. over the past months to a year weve see strikes by minimum wage employees asking for benefits dollars and hour ect. these people are always saying the system is stacked against them they cant get out of their jobs ect. i dropped out of high school my junior year with a . GPA. I was unhappy and dissatisfied with my job so i started at my community college. As of me typing this i am year away from my RN and years away from my BSN. I see my friends and people like me getting the education to be plumbers electricians welders and contractors. These jobs pay extremely well and do not require a formal college education. I feel all these minimum wage workers just dont want to grow up and would rather sit back and work hours a week and complain that they dont make enough or have enough benefits then put in the time or effort to get a well paying job.',\n 'This is born out of a discussion I had with a friend wherein we compared the modern Feminist movement to the ivil Rights ovement of the s. I took the stance that during the ivil Rights era artin Luther King Jr. was more successful than alcolm X because he took a more tempered approach presenting arguments that simply could not be denied and using tactics like sitins to prove the brutality of the oppression by the racists of the era rather than using offensive tactics to get the oppressors to back down in submission. If I recall correctly my friend argued that he was successful because he did not in fact take a tempered approach but instead that his tactics were very inyourface citing his quote that freedom cannot be attained by simply asking. NB I pretty much just talking about civil rights here. Political and economic inequality are somewhat different issues Heres a basic outline of my position and the opposing one y belief Equality for any oppressed group can only logically happen if the enough of the oppressors realize their fault and change Ignorance breeds intolerance and therefore education breeds tolerance In the case of the Feminist movement activists should work to make society aware of problems and favor hard data to rhetoric not that rhetoric isnt useful Youre better served by telling someone why theyre wrong than by berating them riticize the action rather than the person. For example tell someone that what they did was racist not that theyre racist and they should feel ashamed even if they are Equality not only means being able to achieve the same result as another person but being able to achieve it with the same easedifficulty Opposing belief Equality for any oppressed group can only be achieved by empowerment of the oppressed group enabling them to go their own way Gains need to be won without any connection with the oppressor because theyre not going to help. If they were they wouldnt be oppressors Feminist activists should take whats rightfully theirs instead of waiting for it to be handed over to them Youre better off berating someone who practices intolerance to express the seriousness of what theyve done riticizing an intolerant persons character might make them reconsider their positions Activists have been trying to educate for a long time and the hate is still flowing TLDR What serves modern movements like the fights for womens and minority rights better the approach of LK or that of alcolm X?

Weve been looking through the guest list and noticed that some family members and friends are homosexual a couple of lesbians and a gay. We are both atheists and hold no religious views whatsoever however I have always firmly held the belief that marriage is something that celebrates heterosexual partnership and I would be extremely uncomfortable seeing menwomen dancingkissing people of the same sex at the wedding. There is also the problem that one of these people is single and like to try and seduce other women. Im not sure how to deal with her as this would cause great disapproval from both sides of the family and potentially alienate us from family members. Im also worried that family members would think our wedding was a shambles for having them invited in the first place. y SO and I have already made the decision that we arent going to be inviting any homosexual partners as we dont want them to be a part of the wedding. But Im still very unsure about the remaining homosexuals... Anyone care to weigh in? y main concerns are That Im worried because these individuals are heavily into gay culture that they will act very gay and almost make the whole wedding about them being gays at a straight wedding look at us. and That because of the above my family members wont remember my and my fiances special day as a wonderful memory to be cherished but a shambles thats best left forgotten shame on ILikeFoodLots for letting his wedding go on this way...

Im going to talk to the partygoers who I think may cause a scene and just ask them to tone it down for the day just the same as I would with any straight person who would act the same way. Ill point out that Im not singling them out because they are gay but because of the way they act as a person. Im also going to talk with my family members and let them know that this is our decision and that I want them to support us on out big day hopefully Im just overreacting and there wont be an issue.

Ive given the delta to those who I think helped but please let me know if I mistakenly missed you. I wont be able to respond any more but please feel free to continue to post I may be able to come back and talk some more later however again Id say that for now I think my problems are on the way to being resolved and I now see how wrong I was in my old view. Im going to talk to the partygoers who I think may cause a scene and just ask them to tone it down for the day just the same as I would with any straight person who would act the same way. Ill point out that Im not singling them out because they are gay but because of the way they act as a person. Im also going to talk with my family members and let them know that this is our decision and that I want them to support us on out big day hopefully Im just overreacting and there wont be an issue. But if there is I think a lot of you are right in saying that excluding people says far worse about me than anything else ever could. Thanks guys I wish you all successful and happy days and great lives ',\n 'orning ers. Ive got a bit of a dilemma that Im interested in discussing with you all. I hope this is the right place and I think I need an opposing viewpoint on all this. y SO and I are to be soon getting married. Weve been looking through the guest list and noticed that some family members and friends are homosexual a couple of lesbians and a gay. We are both atheists and hold no religious views whatsoever however I have always firmly held the belief that marriage is something that celebrates heterosexual partnership and I would be extremely uncomfortable seeing menwomen dancingkissing people of the same sex at the wedding. There is also the problem that one of these people is single and like to try and seduce other women. Im not sure how to deal with her as this would cause great disapproval from both sides of the family and potentially alienate us from family members. Im also worried that family members would think our wedding was a shambles for having them invited in the first place. y SO and I have already made the decision that we arent going to be inviting any homosexual partners as we dont want them to be a part of the wedding. But Im still very unsure about the remaining homosexuals... Anyone care to weigh in? y main concerns are That Im worried because these individuals are heavily into gay culture that they will act very gay and almost make the whole wedding about them being gays at a straight wedding look at us. and That because of the above my family members wont remember my and my fiances special day as a wonderful memory to be cherished but a shambles thats best left forgotten shame on ILikeFoodLots for letting his wedding go on this way... I appreciate that these people are bigoted but they are my closest family all the same and I want to make them feel special with us. I have to go now but thanks to everyone who contributed even those who were somewhat negative everyone is entitled to their opinion! Ive enjoyed this and can honestly say my view has been changed.

I do not think that an event can have repeated significance beyond its initial occurrence. In this case society prescribes meaning to a birth precisely every days postbirth. Why? Intrinsically there is no value in this date. A day is an approximation of the length of time it takes for the Earth to rotate on its axis with respect to the sun. Had we been living on a different planet on a different solar system we would probably have a different length of day. Why do we assign meaning to the hour period in which we were born when it occurs days later? A year later the day is completely different. The new day has no intrinsic connection to the old day yet we prescribe value to the day in a similar manner. We also make arbitrary exceptions in the form of leap years that further illegitimize the claim of true meaning. Sidenote Ive gotten a considerable amount of shit for having this view. People have taken to verbally assaulting me everytime I say I dont think birthdays mean anything. I desperately want someone to change my view so I am grateful for anyone who attempts to. ',\n 'I actively avoiding the gaming scene for years because of some experiences I had in and after college. One was a DND group a friend invited me to. I was down for it but the experience was really negative. The people werent very friendly or interesting and the game itself was played in a dank basement. Not exactly a fun atmosphere at all. On top of that apparently there are hidden rules to DND. Everything I said I wanted to do I was told You cant do that and instead the play went on around me. Boring. Another instance involved an overnight stay at a friend of a friends. All the roommates except the friends friend were avid TGers. They wouldnt talk merely grunted at us while they shuffled through their cards and played matches. They smelled and the house should have been condemned. The vision of their bathtub will haunt my days. Now you will say these are just anecdotes! But tell me truthfully has any of you ever met an TG player you didnt want to first smack upside the head second shove into a hot shower and third hired a home restoration team to clean and sanitize their house? Thats right. You havent. None of us have. Q. E. D. ',\n 'Teleportation is just so versatile. Why would you choose any other power if you had your pick of the lot?

Worried about being hunted? Teleport you and a spaceship full of oxygen to another galaxy for the night. Hell why not go find another hospitable planet and start colonizing? Ok maybe thatll be a little unfair to mother nature and present a lot of problems in itself. Wow can you imagine the responsibility put on you to solve pretty much all of the mysterious of the universe. Nuh uh. Ok lets keep it within our galaxy. Or maybe this is a good argument against this power? Want to fly? Strap on a suit with those webbed wings type thing and keep teleporting up if youre falling till you catch the winds. What are your thoughts?',\n 'To my way of thinking being a bisexual would be great. The amount of erotica I could view would be increased by a significant degree the potential partners I could have would be increased et cetera. I am actually rather disappointed that I am attracted exclusively to females and have tried with very little success to broaden my interests. I do recognize that bisexuals experience a great deal of bigotry from the general public. However there is an aspect to my orientation I am going to avoid directly mentioning in hopes of keeping this topic on topic that means that I can fairly safely say I already experience as much orientationphobia that a bisexual would or more so the argument of the existence of biphobia will not be compelling. So yeah. Besides that I cant think of any major downsides while I can think of some major upsides to being a bisexual in my specific case and I would choose to be such if orientation could be chosen. . ',\n 'any car crashes are caused by distractions of the driver. One of these distractions is due to listening to music. These distractions are either the driver adjusting the music or just the distraction of the sound. any professional drivers such as airline pilots or train engineers are legally prohibited to listen to music. If professionals are prohibited to listening to music because of distraction then that is even more reason to prohibit amateurs to listening to music. Since enforment of this would be difficult for law enforcement the prohibition needs to be technical. This would mean that all new cars need to turn off music when the car is in motion. Plus all addon sound equipment would need to be designed so that it would work with the technical standards developed to prevent listening to music while driving.

TLDR Be a little patient the worlds not gonna end people will INEITABLY stand up to this practice of destroying our privacy and invading our lives. Its only a matter of time. Sorry for the text wall.

Law enforcement attempts to make this sort of evidence admissible in court publicly a national debate ensues and again the power of warrantless information is legally neutered due to public pressure. Either of these paths could end in two ways peacefully or violently as in notso peaceful protests BUT I simply do not believe that the citizens of the United States or any other country will somehow continue to allow this to progress out of complacency or some crap like that.

Having this knowledge at hand gives women power to properly negotiate their salary thus receiving equal pay to men with the same level of knowledgecredentialsexperience. For example and Im just making these figures up lets say Im applying to be a chemical engineer at a manufacturing facility in incinnati. Based on the extensive research Ive done I know that chemical engineers with my credentials should make between KK a year. I make it through rounds of interviews and the company offers me the job and says theyll pay me K a year. Based on my research I know that number is unfair so I negotiate until I reach somewhere between KK. If the company doesnt agree to pay me what I believe to be the industry standard and what a man would make in that position I walk. Or I accept the lower pay knowing that it is my fault Im making less than what Im worth. Women who complain that they arent making equal pay to men either didnt do their proper research when applying for the job didnt negotiate their salaries effectively or are too lazy to leave and find another job which pays them what theyre worth. For what its worth I am a woman. ! ',\n 'With the advent of the internet it is very easy to see what the average pay for any given position is.

I always enjoyed college games over professional games due to a greater focus on teamwork and strategy as opposed to personalities doing massive feats. While some even the majority of people will always prefer the NBAs entertainment value there is little to be lost by offering the vertically challenged a chance to strut their stuff. uch like boxing while many want to see the heavy hitters engaged in a mighty battle some appreciate the agility and and timing of the lower weight classes. These lower classes are every bit if not more talented but hardly stand a chance when pitted against the heaviest men in the sport. I think basketball also loses many talented players due to the lack of heightclasses. Only reason I couldnt see this happening is funding but for community and school sports it should be a nobrainer. I could see playing up a class as a nonissue but not down so basically a height cap on different leagues as opposed to a height range. ',\n 'In order for a child to be sucessful heshe needs to be raised in a stable household economically socially and emotionally. It is the responsibility of the parents to maintain this stability. A divorce screws up the devolopment of the child because heshe is being removed from the previous household climate and is likely to become depressed and emotionally unstable. The only excusable times for a divorce while raising kids would be if there is clear domestic violence or abuse in which case the child is not safe. Otherwise divorce neglects the childs emotional needs the same way exposing the child to second hand smoke neglicts hisher health needs. arriage is like a contract and it is irresponsible for it to be broken without a valid reason. ',\n 'At the end of the day the decision made by the supreme courts has very limited application. It only applies to companies that are owned at least by or fewer people. This basically means that if you and your family own a company that gets large enough that you can sell some of it to raise capital you can still run it according to your values. This doesnt mean a company the size of apple could do the same thing. It is also almost completely being neglected that it only applies to types of birth control. They didnt limit coverage for all preventative birth control measures only a few retroactive ones that they consider to be similar to abortion. People are also under no obligation to work for these companies. Likely the people who work for these companies work there because they share the values of the company and thus arent affected by the decision. Some people make the argument that its a slippery slope which is a logical fallacy. It doesnt open some Pandoras box. If it did though if the world worked that way I would rather have the box opened that could lead to more individual freedom from governmental power than the box that would be opened with an opposite ruling opening the door for the government to impose laws on anyone regardless of their ideological stances. Why isnt that comparable to mandating prayer in private schools? Im not hristian I dont agree with the Hobby Lobby stances but I think that the Supreme ourt made the morally and constitutionally correct decision. ! ',\n 'any times on online sites you will read a profile describing a person and included in it might be a message ranging from the subtle Looking for racialethnic group here menwomen. the less tactful Not interested in hearing from racialethnic group here. and the obvious Not attracted to insert racialethnic group here. People who do this hide behind having preferences that are harmless. I believe this is racist since outright telling people of certain groups not to contact you means cultural differences are no longer a factor and skin color is the only measure the manwoman is using. I would also like to add that I think not posting this publicly and still rejecting menwoman on the basis of being insert racialethnic group here is also racist. Why do I think this is racist? An individual in this scenario is outright say heshe does not wish to speak to someone on the basis of race and were to assume heshe will ignore comments from individuals belonging to whatever group heshe is excluding. I find this exclusion to be racist and the public shamelessness involved in saying that you dont want to talk to or be contacted by insert racialethnic group here is racist. Id be appalled if I heard someone say this to me in any other circumstance. Why do we make an exception for dating? ',\n 'I am of the belief that appeals to authority may be incorrectly applied but not necessarily. I think any form of inductive reasoning is ultimately an appeal to authority. What is a meaningful difference between the two? After all inductive reasoning is making predictions of the future based on the fact that we expect a pattern to continue while an appeal to authority is a specific form of the same thing. Am I right to equate the two? After all I recognise that inductive reasoning isnt the right tool to use all the time and neither is useless. So whats the difference.

I dont feel that it delivers nearly as much entertainment value as soccer basketball hockey A or almost any other sporting event that has significant notoriety. I feel like the only reason that these sports are American pasttimes are because . They were invented in the US. . arketing. In fact its much more than in my opinion. Its almost terrifying to me that PURE marketing has made a product as terrible as American football so central to American culture. Both the NFL and LB are unnecessarily complex in the way they play the game and have very little actual game per game. This has nothing to do with what other nations play or dont play I just find the NFL and LB to be almost entirely unredeeming events that people only like because they and there family have been marketed the product since birth. The things that people tell me are great qualities about football strategy execution etc. are things that it has less of than several other sports. ore strategy is involved in soccer and A more execution is involved in basketball and hockey. And Ive never had someone give me a decent reason that LB is entertaining at all. I just dont see how these sports are anything but selffulfilling marketing agencies. So please . Its becoming really annoying to suffer through the Super Bowl every year. NOTE I understand both games very well... learning the game is not my issue.',\n 'I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up uslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debatesnewscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the uslim religion. However nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts. In most places women must cover up their breast in public websites consider it nudity and will censor these videosimages and even if it is legal it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs? I invite you all to .',\n 'First I would just like to note that I am writing this in a neutral position. I am neither for nor against the motion of hristian propaganda. With that being said I have meditated and experienced first hand the effects a large gathering of hristians can have on the mindset of a person without a belief system. After visiting a couple church sermons I am amazed at how fast a church is capable of taking someone with a completely opposite mindset and conforming them instantly within a couple sermons. I am even more astounded by how fast churches are capable of taking children and within a week theyve got the child radically supporting an adopted belief system. I thought to myself Either hristianity is so true that a good preacher can convert masses out of how obvious the belief system is or there is some sort of fallacy going on here. Heres what might be happening Take this first set of statements. God exists God doesnt exist Rationally the average person should be able to live their life with an opinion that both possible statements exist as equally as each other even though their contradictory. However the statements are usually phrased like this. God exists. He is all loving all powerful and he is governing the universe with his sense of perfection. There is no god. There is no perfect allpowerful loving being protecting us from harm. The world is not perfect. Even though both those statements have an equal value of being true if we believe that the world is governed by a perfect loving supreme being we would feel a lot happier. Therefore before anyone even enters a church they are already primed to want to believe one statement over the other even though they know rationally that both statements are equal in value. Its a positive outlook bias that our brain performs in order to lead our minds into believing things that make us feel good inside. Now lets look at these statements When we die we are reborn and live eternally. When we die nothing happens. The first statement makes you feel better therefore youre more likely to believe it. What happens after that is the church plays on anticipation. When we die we go to Heaven where we are blissfully happy and reunited with our loved ones. When we die nothing happens. In the first statement you have something to look forward to. In the second statement you have nothing to look forward to. This is the same as flipping a coin and getting a hundred bucks if it lands on heads. Even though you know rationally that either possibility is just as likely the other you want to believe more that the coin is going to land on heads. So is the church converting massive amounts of people weekly because hristianity is so obviously true? Or do pastors already have the deck stacked in their favor before nonbelievers even walk in the door? y view is they have the deck stacked in their favor.

',\n 'olloquially and infection can be cured with antibiotics. It usually refers to what happens when you scrape your knee and dont clean it properly. It gets infected and you take a course of amoxicillin and youre fine. AIDS Herpes hlamydia Syphilis and so forth are much more serious than this. They are dangerous infectious diseases that need to be treated as such. It is my view that the term STI emerged from the STD community as a way for them to not feel like they are carrying a terrible disease but its misleading. The change in the descriptor helps peoples feelings but conveys less information. Saying that someone who has AIDS isnt diseased but merely has an infection significantly reduces the severity of the condition. The person doesnt have an infection in the way we use the term colloquially as though a little pus is forming in a wound but a communicable disease that is highly dangerous. Doctors offices universities health practitioners and so forth should continue using the term STD because it better conveys the conditions represented. ',\n 'Why I want this view changed? I feel about it pretty strongly and all of these are basically going against most relationship advice I hear that is considered mature while my mentality is often regarded as shallow or immature. I wand to understand better where the other side is coming from. Title explains it summed up here are my arguments and additional views that may be relevant . Relationship is not superior to being single and should not be searched for at all cost. Relationship should be wanted only when there is a person you want to be in a relationship with. . You either want someone or you dont. You are either attracted to them or you arent. They can be nice and compatible but if they arent what you want there is no point in trying to make it work for the sake of being nice or fair. Relationships arent deserved. . Preferring physically attractive people does not make you shallow. In fact it is shallow to assume that relationships are so important that persons preferences in them determine their whole depth as human beings. . There is no objective measure as to what should or shouldnt be changed for the sake of your partner. You have to take the person for what they are and not imagine you will change them or compromise and change yourself for them unless it is a change you want to make yourself. For example it is considered unreasonable to expect your SO to stop talking to someone you dont like but it is reasonable to expect your SO to stop drinking every day. In my opinion no one owes their partner a change and no one owes a relationship you can leave over anything you dont like and you dont have to change anything you dont want to. BUT there should be no hard feelings because neither side is a bitch or a jerk for their choice. Its not a moral issue either. . No one owes a relationship. It is ok to only want sex with someone hot over wanting a relationship and looking for deeper things that isnt in any way a moral issue. . Standards arent objective even though many people might share the same standards. You dont have to give back everything you expect you simply have to know what you want and someone either fits or doesnt. . It is stupid that people get offended for not being someones type. You arent hurting anyone by not wanting to be with them over something even if they think the reason isnt fair. Relationships arent favors or rewards anyway. . There is no bad reason to end a relationship. I keep hearing people say how someone broke up with them over something dumb think of it the dumber the reason someone breaks up with you over the more it means that the relationship wasnt that important to them in the first place. Which means the break up was necessary even more so than when people in love break up over something big and understandable. . Being with someone or staying with someone you dont want the most is harming not only you but them as well. Someone might like them more than you do so committing yourself while not that attracted or for the sake of keeping the relationship effort was put in is in fact disrespectful to the other person. Therefore they should not get angry but understand the situation. However problem still is that these type of relationships may not be something many people can handle at least not at this point. But a lot about them makes so much sense to me that now I would change the focus of this view all together because it is only a little part of a much bigger problem underneath.

',\n 'I am going to use the terms proabortion and antiabortion because prolife and prochoice are too loaded. Proabortion is short for in favor of the right to abort. For the record I am a socialist proabortion atheist. Although I disagree with the antiabortion view I dont think it has anything to do with religion or excessive government control. The chief antiabortion argument is that fetuses are alive. Whether life begins at conception weeks or whatever is not the point wherever you draw the line the motivation behind prohibiting abortion is to save lives. Some peoples beliefs about when life begins are determined by their religion. But I see no reason why religion should be the only determining factor. Unless you think its okay to kill newborns you cant criticize someone for wanting to protect a month fetus. And if months is reasonable why not ? And so on. The claim that atheists cant reach the same conclusions as hristians rests on the same logic as the claim that atheists cannot be moral. Libertarians and here I mean genuine libertarians and not Tea Party social conservatives can also be antiabortion without being hypocrites. Libertarians are not anarchists they believe there should be some laws in order to protect your basic rights just not too many. No right is more fundamental than life. So if a libertarian believes life begins at conception whether because of religious or other views it is fine for himher to want to outlaw abortion. Since I am neither libertarian nor antiabortion Im not particularly emotionally invested in this view so it shouldnt be too hard to change though I admit I can be stubborn sometimes.

',\n 'To me it seems as if men have no safe spaces to talk to other men about things. Here are some things that I viewed as traditionally viewed as safe spaces for men ideo games which were dominated by men for a while now have even genders overall in hard core games where women are a low percentage the gamer communitygames themselves are labeled as sexist. See Female character model controversies irrors Edge Assassins reed etc. Jobs dominated by men engineering blue collar jobs etc. are being encouraged more and more for females to join. At the same time society is essentially calling these jobscompanies sexist because of the low percentages of women which has resulted in lots of companies pushing hard for more women in the work place. Domestic shelters are dominated in numbers by women with few shelters being available for men. Websites on the internet like reddit have the communities called sexist all the time and even now we are seeing a constant push towards making reddit more female friendly see twoxchromosomes becoming a default subreddit and pushing aside the male demographic. Anyway the result of all of this is I think that men essentially have limitedno avenues for places to talk to other men where as women have a plethora of places that they can go to. Any place that was once traditionally male dominated is being gutted but females still get to keep their exclusivity. ?',\n 'First I will be referring to American Football as football and the sport commonly referred to as football in many regions as soccer. I dont do this to make a point but just because I am in the USA and thats how we generally refer to the sports here. Were I in the UK I would definitely say American Football and Football. To give you some perspective I am a football NFL fan and in the past year I got much more into watching the games. I really enjoy watching football. When I was able to I watched some of the World up games and I did enjoy watching them but the whole time I just wished I was watching football. Just to clarify I really hope someone can change my mind because I really enjoy watching football and I would love to be able to enjoy watching soccer as well! I feel like theres more of a global following for soccer and that might have some fun implications. That said Ill get into it Things that bug me about watching soccer In football people often slam into each other at full speed. In soccer it seems to me that any accidental unavoidable contact results in a penalty. The penalty at the end of the Netherlands exico game basically completely decided the game and as I recall it didnt seem at least to me that it was intentional. As I recall it was almost unavoidable but it decided the entire game! One guy was trying to kick the ball another guy was near him and their legs touched and thats the game! It was so unsatisfying. If penalties arent being called on the players it seems to me like the players are constantly desperately trying to get the refs to call penalties. It seems like every time two people come within a couple of inches of each other one of them intentionally falls down looks at the ref angrily sometimes pretends to hold their leg in pain and in the case where a penalty isnt called gets up and continues playing as if nothing happened in other words they were obviously faking an injury. You can watch a game go on for minutes and have nothing happen at all then sneeze and miss a goal. At least in football you know when a play is going to start so you know when you have to pay rapt attention. In soccer it seems like you have to stare at the screen for minutes straight for fear of missing a goal. The penalty shootout feels like a copout. I know it isnt realistic to just keep playing for forever but I was really rooting for hile and I was really bummed at how they got knocked out. Things that I like about watching soccer Fewer commercial breaks. I really do appreciate this although it goes hand in hand with above. Global community. In football the Philadelphia Eagles is just as likely to have someone from Texas or Alabama or Oklahoma as Philadelphia. In soccer I really enjoyed watching the players get tearful as they sang their National Anthems. So awesome! Although I do think the penalty shootouts are a bit of a copout while watching hile and Brazils shootout as well as osta Rica and Greece I was definitely enjoying myself and on the edge of my seat. On one hand it is sort of a copout but on the other hand it is similar to a game being won by a field goal at the end of a football game. Things I like about football which are absent in soccer I feel like football has more structure. Theres more room for strategy there is more variability between the positions and theres a variety of different plays screen pass ground attack long bomb short pass play action etc. It may be that soccer has similar strategy and I just dont know about it. Further football seems to have better time management. Theres time outs quarters time stops on a missed pass or an injury as opposed to soccer where time never stops and the refs just add some random amount of time to the clock when the half is over. Theres more variety. Like I said different plays different skill sets for different players touchdowns field goals passing running punting etc. In soccer theres only a goal which brings me to my next point Theres so much action! In football an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer both of those things seem to happen every seconds. In football a game where one team scored once or zero times and the other team scored two or less times would be a pretty boring game. In soccer and seem to be pretty common scores. So please !

The general take away from this as far as I can tell is A I need to learn more of the rules of soccer B I need to stop trying to watch soccer as if its football and instead watch it like its soccer. Thanks again! ',\n 'First I will be referring to American Football as football and the sport commonly referred to as football in many regions as soccer. I dont do this to make a point but just because I am in the USA and thats how we generally refer to the sports here. Were I in the UK I would definitely say American Football and Football. To give you some perspective I am a football NFL fan and in the past year I got much more into watching the games. I really enjoy watching football. When I was able to I watched some of the World up games and I did enjoy watching them but the whole time I just wished I was watching football. Just to clarify I really hope someone can change my mind because I really enjoy watching football and I would love to be able to enjoy watching soccer as well! I feel like theres more of a global following for soccer and that might have some fun implications. That said Ill get into it Things that bug me about watching soccer In football people often slam into each other at full speed. In soccer it seems to me that any accidental unavoidable contact results in a penalty. The penalty at the end of the Netherlands exico game basically completely decided the game and as I recall it didnt seem at least to me that it was intentional. As I recall it was almost unavoidable but it decided the entire game! One guy was trying to kick the ball another guy was near him and their legs touched and thats the game! It was so unsatisfying. If penalties arent being called on the players it seems to me like the players are constantly desperately trying to get the refs to call penalties. It seems like every time two people come within a couple of inches of each other one of them intentionally falls down looks at the ref angrily sometimes pretends to hold their leg in pain and in the case where a penalty isnt called gets up and continues playing as if nothing happened in other words they were obviously faking an injury. You can watch a game go on for minutes and have nothing happen at all then sneeze and miss a goal. At least in football you know when a play is going to start so you know when you have to pay rapt attention. In soccer it seems like you have to stare at the screen for minutes straight for fear of missing a goal. The penalty shootout feels like a copout. I know it isnt realistic to just keep playing for forever but I was really rooting for hile and I was really bummed at how they got knocked out. Things that I like about watching soccer Fewer commercial breaks. I really do appreciate this although it goes hand in hand with above. Global community. In football the Philadelphia Eagles is just as likely to have someone from Texas or Alabama or Oklahoma as Philadelphia. In soccer I really enjoyed watching the players get tearful as they sang their National Anthems. So awesome! Although I do think the penalty shootouts are a bit of a copout while watching hile and Brazils shootout as well as osta Rica and Greece I was definitely enjoying myself and on the edge of my seat. On one hand it is sort of a copout but on the other hand it is similar to a game being won by a field goal at the end of a football game. Things I like about football which are absent in soccer I feel like football has more structure. Theres more room for strategy there is more variability between the positions and theres a variety of different plays screen pass ground attack long bomb short pass play action etc. It may be that soccer has similar strategy and I just dont know about it. Further football seems to have better time management. Theres time outs quarters time stops on a missed pass or an injury as opposed to soccer where time never stops and the refs just add some random amount of time to the clock when the half is over. Theres more variety. Like I said different plays different skill sets for different players touchdowns field goals passing running punting etc. In soccer theres only a goal which brings me to my next point Theres so much action! In football an interception or a completed pass is exciting. In soccer both of those things seem to happen every seconds. In football a game where one team scored once or zero times and the other team scored two or less times would be a pretty boring game. In soccer and seem to be pretty common scores. So please !

Thanks again! ',\n 'Ive noticed that there are a lot of guys specifically people who are NOT Asian who have yellow fever. Or there are white girls with jungle fever who will only date black men. They try to justify that this is a preference but this makes me uncomfortable. The thing Im talking about is mostly sexualregarding sexual attraction. Its about the people who watch specifically Asian porn where Asian females are depicted as weak and submissive. It seems to be taking objectification to an extreme level. When that same person dates a person of their preferred race. It makes me question Are they dating this person because they are kind generous lively and intelligent? Or because they are Asian? When the person dates outside of their preferred race it makes me sad because their partner will never fit their standard of true innate attractiveness. I hope my opinion is making sense. The reason I want to change it is because Ive come to resent people who have these racial preferences even if they truly cannot help it. Thank you so much for anyone who chooses to answer this. Im willing to expand on this view if need be. It was recommended that I edit this post. I am trying to focus on the objectificationsexualization part of all of this. I have no problem with dating in or outside of race. Im talking about sexual fantasies and sexual expectations Asian women expected to be submissive Latinas expected to be feisty black women expected to be animalistic',\n 'Greetings Reddit As horrific and racist as my title sounds Id like to start by saying that I am hardly a racist person by nature and do not discriminate in my dealings with anyone. This is simply a belief that Ive held for quite some time based on my study of history and observation of presentday situations. Unfortunately I cant seem to bring this up without being called racist so Im genuinely interested in hearing a sound argument that doesnt involve that logic. I believe that slavery gave African descendants a better future in the Americas particularly the USA than they would have otherwise had in Africa. Africa was and still is a pretty awful place to live in. Between AIDS and other diseases famine civil unrest inadequate healthcare lack of electricitywater and nonexistent educational systems shouldnt African Americans be glad that they are in America now and not Africa? Would todays African Americans not certainly be in a worse state if they had been born in Africa today? Im well aware that the initial slaves brought over had to suffer horrific atrocities and it is a tragedy that they had to be subjected to such immense terror. They clearly did not benefit. But their children? Or their grandchildren? The African Americans of today arent they better off because of slavery? So thats about it hange y iew. But Id like to say thanks to ufibonacciapples for putting a different spin on things by pointing out that I should consider the entirety of time between slavery and today not just the present state of AfricanAmericans.
