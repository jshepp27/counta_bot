      "0: racism has never been an issue for the US. Its just a fact. For the past century the US has been on a steady march toward progressive politics. This trend is changing as Americans make more informed about their own political views. There is now a growing body of studies suggesting that this trend is not going to continue. A study of American citizens suggests that despite the rhetoric of Republican politicians the US can still win elections in many areas on the political left of the country. This is largely true because the candidate who wins has a strong base of support with women voters. In fact the US elections in several states were even more favorable for women voters with candidates with the word of Republican Presidential candidate James R. Dole than in any other state. Also many Americans are now familiar with how Republicans are typically made up of Republicans and how they tend to vote Democratic. One study even shows how the idea of the Republican party is far superior to that of the Democrats. You can see the shift to the Democrats in popular opinion polls in states where women are more likely to vote than men. This helps explain why so many young women would prefer Republicans to the Democrats. When Americans were in elementary school our parents wanted their children to be politically active as opposed to just as likely to vote for the Democrats. Then when we began in college we needed our parents to go to college but only if our parents were willing to go out of their way to be politically active. This is the same reason why Republicans and women\n",

      "2: racism does not necessarily imply that there is a universal truth about our relationship to each other. Indeed it does not imply that there should be absolute rule. I am one of those people not in the best of positions but I will argue that the nature of belief in this truth is that its true that people are attracted to certain types of truths. This is important because it is also an important one to consider when considering the nature of belief in a universal truth. Some people who think that this universal truth is true are more likely to be motivated by a general interest. Others are looking to specific truths that do not lie and may not even be true. belief in this truth is different and people who are attracted to certain facts are more likely to look to facts that do not lie than ones that do. The notion that this fact is an important thing is important because it means that a given idea of what one might like or dislike would be false in some sense if the truth of the belief in that is not true. The fact that we can never be certain that weve chosen the truth of the belief does not necessarily imply that we want to be certain that we could never do so if we were not willing to look to things which are false. A good example of this is how people with certain beliefs or beliefs about a subject may be drawn to the belief that some one could do something nice for them without actually agreeing with it as being good for them personally.
